        <p class="p1"> The jobs on land that are available are low-grade and demeaning. Your job is to clean the sewage pipes. They were right, they do pay enough—but barely! You can only afford the lowest-quality food, clothing, and other essentials. It’s too bad you weren’t born a mermaid...otherwise you’d have one of the good jobs, and the better food, clothing, and mansions they have underwater.
