    <p class="p1"> You grab about 20 bags of FlooFloo seeds, making sure to fill your pockets, too. You quietly exit the room, creep down the hall, and out of the palace.<br><br>
	You make your way back to your ship. Thankfully, there are no Pawians out, and lights are off. However, once your reach the spaceship, you see there are three Pawians blocking the entrance, all with weapons.<br><br>
	“And to think we could trust you...but you’re a human, after all. You have failed our second test.”<br><br>
	They killed you!
