    <p class="p1"> After a restful night’s sleep, you go down to the courtyard to meet with the Pawian leaders.<br><br>
	“We hope you were able to sleep well! We want to say thank you.”<br><br>
	“For what?” you ask.<br><br>
	“For not stealing our FlooFloo supply! We have cameras in there. Although you shouldn’t have entered, we are happy that you did not take our hard-earned supply. You have earned our trust, and you are welcome to stay on Whopp as long as you would like.”<br><br>
	Yay!
