    <p class="p1"> “Hello, friend!” the one in the front says once they are close to you. They all bow, and you do the same. “How were your travels?”<br><br>
	“Not too bad,” you say.<br><br>
        “We have been awaiting your return.” <i>My return? But I just got here.</i> “Come now, we can get settled in. I’m sure you are tired from your long quest—you deserve rest, and a great banquet afterward for everything you have done for Whopp!”<br><br>
        <i>What?</i> Then it dawns on you. They’re blind—that explains the way they walk, their glasses, and whoever they seem to be mistaking you for.<br><br>
	You could tell them the truth—that you’re from Earth. Or you could play along; who knows what they think of Earth’s humans?
