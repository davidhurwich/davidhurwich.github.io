        <p class="p1"> You laugh it off. “Yeah, I guess so.” You give your best smile. Look friendly! They might be your only chance of survival.<br><br>
“What happened to your planet?” the merman asks.<br><br>
“It was destroyed. I’m the last human left, so I took my spaceship and went here.”<br><br>
“That is unfortunate. Despite your...appearance...we welcome you!”<br><br>
Trading their fins for legs in some sort of indescribable magic, the Elleknores take you on a tour of their kingdom.<br><br>
“We have plenty of good jobs here. Unfortunately, the majority of them take place underwater. Our few land jobs do pay enough—are you okay with that?”<br><br>
You need the work to survive, so you don’t have much of a choice.
