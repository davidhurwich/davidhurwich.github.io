            <h1> Train Problem </h1>
        </header>

        <p class="p1"> After a good night’s sleep, you walk to the palace across town to meet with the Wymphs.<br><br>
You see a train approaching nearby, and a few yards in front of you on the tracks are three Wymph civilians whose long dresses have gotten caught in the railway tracks—unable to move. The train is headed straight toward them. You are closest in proximity to them. You could try helping them get their dresses uncaught, but risk failing and dying, too. Or you could stand by.<br><br>
If you do nothing, they will die.<br><br>
If you help them, you could die, too.
