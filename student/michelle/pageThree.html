           <h2> THE NEXT DAY </h2>
           <p> You wake up in your own bed, and get ready. As you are getting ready, you noticed red blotches on your shirt, and start to question where it was from. You quickly change into new clothes to do some house chores. </p> <p> In the living room, you receive an unusual call. You decide to pick up, and find out it's your local police station. They said that you might be a prime suspect for your neighbor, Martha's murder. </p>
