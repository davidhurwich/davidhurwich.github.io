        Your adrenaline is pumping!






            <p>You chose to stay quiet. You look around in fear. Not knowing if you will ever make it back to your Mom and Carla. All you see around you are trees that are as big as a house. </p>



            <p>You look around for a path. Maybe it will lead you out of the forest and back to your mom.</p>



            <p>You start to walk through bushes and see a car with an open trunk you can hop into. You might be able to get a ride back to Mom or you can try to find a path leading to the left hoping you can find Mom and Carla on your own. </p>


        

           
             
                

<p>Trunk or Path?
