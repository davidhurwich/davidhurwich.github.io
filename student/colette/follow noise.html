                 <P>You are following the noise you heard in the cave. It sounds like faint whispers. "where are you" "where are you?".</P>
                 <p>You keep on walking in this pitch-black cave, soon enough you start to see a faint light very far away.  As you keep walking the light gets bigger.</p>
                 <p>You finally think to yourself this could be another way out of this cave. You start running and right when you come out on the other side you see familiar faces. </p>
