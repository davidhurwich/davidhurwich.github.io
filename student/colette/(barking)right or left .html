                 <p>Your adrenaline is pumping!</p>



                 <p>Everything is so quiet, all you know to do is start barking for help but you hear nothing. You listen everything is still quiet, you feel so alone and lost. You look around as you start barking again but this time...loud sounds start coming over from the right past some bushes. you think to yourself, " if I pick the wrong way I could be in danger."</p>



 



                 <p>Go to the right to the noise or left where it is quiet?</p>
