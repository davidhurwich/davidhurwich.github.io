                 <p>You decided to stay where you are in the cave.</p>



               
                 <p>An hour goes by and the storm has gotten worse. But this time lighting starts to go off. When right out of nowhere lighting hits the top of the cave causes an avalanche of rocks to fall right on top of you! </p> 
                <p> Right when this rock  hits you everything goes black.</p>
                 <p>   You wake up and right next you is you mom and Carla laying down on a blanet taking a nap. This was all just a dream!</p>
