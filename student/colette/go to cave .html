                 <p>You approach the cave, you look inside to see if you see anything and it looks like you are in the clear. While you are sitting in this cave  noises coming from the back. </p>
                 <p> You look over but you cannot see the end of the cave as well as not being able to see what is making that noise.

                     You sit there wondering if there is an end to it and if I do follow that noise what is making that noise?</p>
