                 <p> The rain is starting to pour even harder. Soon enough you start to hear lighting go off. You are running thinking if you are out here any longer this storm your life could be in danger.</p>
                
                 <P>  In a blink of an eye, you slip and slide over to the right and stay to sliding down this dirty hill. By the time you are at the bottom, you are completely covered in mud. You look and start to smell something familiar.</P>
                 <p> You look up at two worries faces it is your mom and Carla! All this pressure lifts off your chest and feel so much better to be back in the arms of loved ones.</p>
