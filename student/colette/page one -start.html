                 <p>Your adrenaline is pumping!</p>



<p>You just ran after the fastest squirrel you have ever chased. It was a instinct to follow after it and try to catch it. When you think you caught up you realize that you lost track of the squirrel. You look around you don't know where you are. Lost in the woods far away from your mom. What do you do?</p>



<p>Start barking or Stay quiet?
