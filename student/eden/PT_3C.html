			The closer you reach the crash site, you see burnt track marks on the dirt and little fires on the sides that will eventually burn out. You slowly start to see your flashlight exposing a large silver looking craft that’s buried itself in the brush. Suddenly, a grey alien looking thing lifts itself out of the silver craft. It looks at you, and you suddenly know the situation; the grey alien crashed and while doing so, an important disc was detached and fell somewhere. You immediately hear a voice that is not yours, asking, “Will you help me find that disk? It’s not far. Please find it and bring it to me so I can be on my way.”
