			You begin to follow the voice as it carefully directs you to some unknown beaten path, slowly moving further away from all of the commotion. Your flashlight reveals a glimmer ahead, and you realize it must be the crashed ship. The more you move closer to the ship, you realize the disc becomes hotter and hotter. You quickly throw the burning disc out of your pocket and it immediately flies toward the ship like a magnet, Astonished, you watch the ship glowing and beginning to float in midair. “Thank you.” the voice said, “Leave before they come. Hurry!”
