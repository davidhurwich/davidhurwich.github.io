			You back away in disbelief and can’t believe what you are hearing and seeing. Scared out of your mind, you quickly turn around and run back to your campsite and call 911. When the authorities arrive, you also notice unmarked vans with gentleman wearing suits inside. Before you can even question it, a park ranger approaches you and asks for your story. When you finish telling him, he looks at you like you’re crazy and hears something in his earpiece. Nodding as an understood, he tells you the park is closed and in the meantime, to pack up and go. You do as you’re told, get in the car, and drive home until you see the sun poking out behind the horizon, welcoming you to the new day.
