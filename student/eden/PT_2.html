			The sun turns itself in for the night as the moon begins to rise. You put out the campfire and decide to go to bed, leaving a couple of lanterns on so you’re not in complete darkness. As you begin to drift off to sleep, you begin to hear a faint noise in the distance. You put it off as nothing, but the noise persists and becomes louder….and LOUDER. You decide to leave the tent, and as you do, you see something tumbling down into the forest, and hear a loud crash. You look towards the noise and see a light illuminating some of the trees as you begin to realize that the very thing that crashed is now glowing. Now you feel the need to have to check it out.
