		<p>
			Started out as a serene solo camping experience in the woods, you witness an out of this world crash near your campsite. When investigating the site, you find an extraterrestrial in the downed spacecraft, and he asks for your help to find the missing piece to his ship so he can continue on his way home. Will you help him?
