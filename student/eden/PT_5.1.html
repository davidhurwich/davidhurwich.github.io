			The gentleman examines the small disk and begins to turn away from you. Before you can say anything to him, you hear him whispering into his earpiece. You suddenly hear a large crack behind you and quickly turn around and your flashlight reveals it was just a raccoon. Relieved, you turn back around to ask for the disk back, but when you do, no one is there. Feeling stupid, you frantically run around the area trying to find this mysterious gentleman. How hard is it to spot someone in a suit? While looking, you spot a park ranger and begin to ask him if he’s seen anyone such as that gentleman. He responds no, but informs you that there has been a crash and the park is now closed, and tells you that you need to pack up and leave. You walk back to your campsite, and notice a large amount of responding vehicles and unmarked cars. You do as you’re told, get in the car, and drive home until you see the sun poking out behind the horizon, welcoming you to the new day.
