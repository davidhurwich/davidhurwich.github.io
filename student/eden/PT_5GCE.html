			You begin approaching the crash site and notice that there is no way in, due to the amount of law enforcement vehicles and unmarked vans that are in the area. You have no idea how they were able to drive in such terrain. You decide to check in your pocket and realize its empty. Freaking out, you frantically search all of your pockets to no avail. You have a washing feeling of embarrassment, as you begin to realize the gentleman that bumped into you must’ve stolen it! There’s no way you dropped something so important! Upset, you realize there is nothing you can do for the alien, and decide to head back to your campsite, and while doing so, a park ranger approaches you and informs you that there was a crash near by and the park is closed and to pack your things. You do as you’re told, get in the car, and drive home until you see the sun poking out behind the horizon, welcoming you to the new day.
