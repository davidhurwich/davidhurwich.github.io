			You call yourself crazy and ignore the voice while walking back to your campsite. While doing so, a park ranger approaches you and informs you that there was a crash near by and the park is closed and to pack your things. You do as youâ€™re told, get in the car, and drive home until you see the sun poking out behind the horizon, welcoming you to the new day.  You still have the disc with you, and keep it as a souvenir to remember the craziest camping trip ever.
