			Youâ€™re excited as can be when you find the trail that leads to some of the most gorgeous campsites known in the area. You decided awhile ago that for your birthday, you wanted to do a solo camping trip, and it was worth it! As you begin to walk, the forest starts to engulf you in its lush green sea of trees. You notice how the air is fresh and crisp, and the further you walk and pass by various different spots to camp, you finally find the perfect space; overlooking the sea of forest and greenery, with the mountains hugging the horizon. You begin to set up camp and start a fire and you can take your eyes off the view.
