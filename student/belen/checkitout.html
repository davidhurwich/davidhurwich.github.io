                You slowly get out of the tent trying to make the least noise possible.
                <br>
                <br>
                You start walking towards where you heard Kevin's voice. It is pitch black everywhere you turn adding to the fear that is already there.
                <br>
                <br>
                As you hear the crunch to your footsteps through the unknown you stop. You can sense you are in the same space as someone...something?
                <br>
                <br>
                You whisper, "Kevin?" and remember your keychain has a mini flashlight. You reach to your pocket and turn it on, you point it right in front of you and see two small blue circles floating and realize it is a huge bear you are walking towards.
                <br>
                <br>
                You feel someone grab your arm and gasp, it's Kevin.
