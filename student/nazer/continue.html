                <p>You decided to continue forward. As you reach the top of the peak there is a small sigh of relief. There is a large rock near by and you sit on it to just take in the view. You feel the cool breeze kiss your face as you look into the valley. Everything looks so small for where you are at! Like you're on top of the world... Epic</p>
