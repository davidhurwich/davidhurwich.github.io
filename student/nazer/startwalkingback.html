                <p>You start walking back down the trail. More like limping. Everything around you is changing. The trees branches look like hands, the dirt beneath your feet is flowing as if it's water. "crap" you say to yourself as you realize, "I'm in shock, I'm tripping!"</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>You do all that you can to stay focused but the air is getting thinner. You fall to your knees and wail in pain... "Where are those damn medics!"</p>
