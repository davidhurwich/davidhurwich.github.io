                <p> Riley finally makes it out of the emergency room, and it looks like they have crutches. You guys take an uber to get some coffee at a cafe near by. As you get to talking there a quick realization that riley is pretty cool. </p>
                <p> Once you guys reach the cafe you thank you uber driver and get out.</p>
                <p>You tell riley to sit and you'll get the drinks. They hand you cash and you walk in and order. But now you are stuck between choosing Coffee or Tea. </p>
