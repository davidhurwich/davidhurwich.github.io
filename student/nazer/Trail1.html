                <p>You decide to take trail one, the scenic view! This is a bit longer of a hike so make sure to keep pushing forward. As you reach mid way up the trail you hear someone asking for help.</p>
                <p> "what is going on" you say to yourself.</p>
                <p>As you get closer to the sound you realize that it's another hiker, but they're injured.</p>
                <p>"hi, I'm Riley, can you please help me"?</p>
                <p>They twisted their ankle pretty bad and needs medical attention.</p>
