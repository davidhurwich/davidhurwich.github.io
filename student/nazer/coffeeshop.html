                <p>You decided it's best to just stick with a coffee, yum! Once you get the drinks you bring them out side and sit down. As you get to talking more you think you yourself, 'Riley is really chill' and you guys seem to be hitting it off.</p>
                <p>They ask to hangout again another time. "Maybe go on a hike?"</p>
                <p>You spit out your coffee and laugh, "yeahhh, maybe"</p>
