                <p>As you come up to the main trail there are three smaller trails to choose from. Remember, the first route has a scenic view of the local area and open space that takes an hour longer to reach the top. The second route is steeper and full of bush, but will get you to the top much quicker. The last route has both a scenic view and open trail space. There's animal prints on the ground (looks like a deer).</p>
