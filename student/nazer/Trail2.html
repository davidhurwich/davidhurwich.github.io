                <p>You are moving up trail two! It is a little steeper of a hike and you need to not drink all your water in one sitting. As you finish half your water, you realize that tree branches are falling infront of you. You can push forward and run past the falling branches or turn back. You've gotten pretty far anyway; you can reach the top another day if you want.</p>
