            <section> There is a main trail behind your old high school that leads to three smaller routes reaching the top of the peak. With you is a bag filled with water, food, first aid, and a phone. The first route has a scenic view of the local area and open space that takes an hour longer to reach the top. The second route is steeper and full of bush, but will get you to the top much quicker. The last route has both a scenic view and open trail space. There's animal prints on the ground (looks like a deer). Nothing too crazy. The goal is to reach the top before mid-afternoon, but there may be other wins a head... </section>
