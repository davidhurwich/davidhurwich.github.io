                <p>You decide it's important to make sure Riley gets back safe. Using your first aid kit in your bag you wrap their ankle and help them up. As you both start walking back down you become friends! They are super and sweet and offer to buy you a coffee later after the hospital visit. It's the best way they can thank you </p>
