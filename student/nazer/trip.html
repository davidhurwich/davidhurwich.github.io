                <p>The sky begins to dim as you sit in the middle of the trail. There's a first aid in your bag but you're so weak. The birds sound nice in the distance, but there's one bird that sounds weird. As you try to listen it gets closer and louder. Sounds like.. no it couldn't be... propelers?!</p>
                <p>They found you! "thank goodness" you say as you begin to drift off.</p>
                <p>A medic shoots down and begins talking to you.</p>
                <p>"It's going to be fine, you're going to be fine"</p>
                <p>"we got you"</p>
                <p> You can finally rest as they begin to care for your wound, it's been a long and crazy day.</p>
