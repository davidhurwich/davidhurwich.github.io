                <p>The easy way out! Trail three has a scenic view and open space. Time for a nice adventure! As you continue through you realize that there is nothing more relaxing than this. You grap a quick snack while walking, as you munch on your granola bar you see a deer off in the distance. How cute. Its important that you get past the deer to finish your hike and reach the top. </p>
                <p> You shove the rest of your granola bar in your mouth, wipe your hands off on your shorts and tighten your shoe laces... it's time to decide! what are you going to do?</p>
