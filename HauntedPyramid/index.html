                <p class="question"> What is this exactly?</p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>
                        Curse of the Mummy is a special trick-or-treat experience. It's a local DIY halloween experience
                        meant for children ages 5 - 12. Kids can enter into the spooky Egyptian tomb to retrieve candy.
                        The experience will include sound, video and other elements.

                </div>
                <p class="question"> Where and When is it Occuring?</p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>It is occuring at 1735 39th ave, San Francisco, CA 94122. <br>
                        October 31st, 2022 Halloween night from 5pm - 10pm</p>
                </div>

                <p class="question"> Is it free?</p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yup!</p>
                </div>

                <p class="question"> Is there Candy?</p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <p>Yup!</p>
                </div>



                <p class="question"> Is this Too Scary for My Kids?</p>
                <div class="answer">
                <p>I created this experience with young children in mind. It's more spooky / creepy than scary. No
                    blood or gore, no one popping out to scare anyone. Think Addams Family / The Munsters not Texas
                    Chainsaw Massacre / Saw.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If
                    children do not wish to go into the tomb they can request not to go and will be given the candy in
                    the front of the house.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p class="question"> How Long is the Experience?</p>
                <div class="answer">
                <p> Not very long, I would say realistically kids would spend 5 - 10 minutes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of the day this is a DIY experience made by a passionate designer as a fun side project.
                    But it is no means meant to be a professional experience like Disneyland. Please keep expectations
                    at a reasonable level.
                </p>
            </div>
                <p class="question"> Is there anything to do besides enter the Tomb?</p>
                <div class="answer">
                <p> Yes! There will be other activites including an Egyptian ring toss and fun 3D optical posters for
                    kids to view.</p>
                </div>
                <p class="question"> Are you Participating in the Great Hauntway?</p>
                <div class="answer">
                <p> Yes! We will be there, although the experience will be scaled down as the Great Hauntway does not
                    want large structures.</p>
