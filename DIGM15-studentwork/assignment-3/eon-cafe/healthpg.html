                    <div>
                    <p>Pi water was recently discovered in Japan and through various experiments, and is found to have health improving characteristics.

(In 1998) Researchers found that Pi water is most similar to human body liquids. Pi water has been approved by the Water Quality Association and holds one of the highest positions of quality in the water industry. According to the WQA, Pi water has the number one anti-oxidation effect compared to any other type of water. The anti-oxidation power of the water helps the cells of our body age slower. Pi water has had the effect of making people look and feel younger.</p>
                        <p>
