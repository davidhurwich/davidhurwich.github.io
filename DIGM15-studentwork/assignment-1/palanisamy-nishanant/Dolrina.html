            You arrive at Dolrina, a planet that orbits two suns. You have heard of such places but have never been to one before, and understably you are in amazed. You realize a few minutes later after remembering from your school curriculum that Dolrina is completely uninhabited at this moment; it was used as a mining planet by various companies from other planets.

            You follow the map over mountains, a beach, and a canyon. You land on the spot marked on the map, which required some trawling through some cramped mining tunnels. You inspect the rock that is described. Sure enough, there is an arrow pointing toward a bright planet (Krygonus) off in the distance. With your new knowledge of where to go next, you stetch your back and get ready for take-off!
