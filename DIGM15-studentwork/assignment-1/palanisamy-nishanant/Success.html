            How amazing! You did it! After all that hard work and decision-making, your efforts have paid off tremendously! You have finally reached Tara's Orb, an extraordinarily powerful object with which Pluto has used to imperialize the Gas Giants of your solar system. The Plutonian government still has no idea where it is right now, but they are searching as hard as they can. Many planets can feel relieved knowing it's in the hands of a reasonable, just, and benevolent being like yourself.

            The cube that the orb was held inside has been floating in the middle of seemingly nowhere. You feel it is best to destroy it with your ship's turret. It is time to fly back home! Safe travels and be careful with your decisions regarding Tara's Orb!
