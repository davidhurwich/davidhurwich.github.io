            Unfortunately, the answer you gave was not the one that would have gotten you to Tara's Orb. The wormhole you take sends you back to Earth and this long, arduous journey has completely tired you out. Your triceps feel depleted and you need to start hitting the gym again as part of getting back to your Earthly routine. But first, time for a big nap!

            Just remember, it's always about the destination, but the FRIENDS we make along the WAY. Sweet dreams!
