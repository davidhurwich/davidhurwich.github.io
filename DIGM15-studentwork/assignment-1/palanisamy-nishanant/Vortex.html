            It's understandable that Mr. Feller was really intimidating. When you told him that you're only passing by, he let you go and you hurried off in your spaceship without collecting yourself and looking ahead. Regardless, the massive vortex near Kepliron that is pretty difficult to avoid has now pulled you in and you have to just sit back and relax for some time.

            You take this time now to rest up and think about what could be up next. Thankfully, you know that you'll be safe as the spaceship you are in is incredibly durable and still has most of its fuel left.
