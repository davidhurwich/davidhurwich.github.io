            You have arrived at Kurger Bing, a planet with a moon that orbits absurdly close to it and often serves as a huge travel and employment destination for citizens. You land near Bojangles, one of the largest cities of Kurger Bing, where skyscrapers pierce the clouds and aircrafts hover about as commuters rush to work.

He seems to be the CEO of the company that is using the building, and you are shocked to see him dancing away as he spins and breakdances on his massive desk to Kurgerian pop music. Reading the nametag on his desk, you find out he goes by Gyrating Gerald.
