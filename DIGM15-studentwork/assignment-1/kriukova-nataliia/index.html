            <p>I am an astronaut. I explored the nearest part of the Galaxy and found a lot of interesting things. Now
                I'm ready to return to my homeplanet. However, yesterday I got into a meteor storm, and my ship is
                losing power. The ship can't take me home. I must find resources to repair the ship. Nearby I found
                three suitable planets X, Y, Z, and I'm going there.
