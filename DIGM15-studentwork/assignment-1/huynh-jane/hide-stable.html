                <p class="story">You decide to hide in one of the many stables in the empty barn that has a stack of
                    boxes in the corner. You quickly overturn and crawl underneath a huge box in a fetus position. You
                    hear the doors slam open and laughter fills the barn. You pray and quiet your breaths. Stomp stomp
                    stomp. You hear lots of stuff thrown around, and the stable doors are all being kicked open.
                    However, the serial killer miraculously doesn’t find you! It becomes silent.</p>
