                <p class="story">Rummaging through the drawers of the office, you find an emergency satellite phone.
                    Your eyes tear up in relief and you call the police for help. You hide in a closet in the office
                    until you hear sirens in the distance. Help is here and the killer is arrested. You sit in shock in
                    an ambulance. You escaped successfully, but most of your friends are dead.</p>
