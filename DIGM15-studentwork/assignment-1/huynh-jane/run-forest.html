                <p class="story">You decide to run to the forest and notice at least one other friend runs with you. You
                    feel a bit of relief to have somebody with you in this life-threatening situation. The forest looms
                    over you. You remember on the campground map there was a barn near the cabin. Do you run further
                    into the forest or head towards the barn?</p>
