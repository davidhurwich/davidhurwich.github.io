                <p class="story"> You decide to separate from your friend and run through the forest alone. Your
                    heartbeat pounds in your ears drowning out any other noise as the forest blurs around you. As you
                    separate from your friend, you rush through the forest in hopes of finding a hiding place that the
                    mountain lion might overlook while chasing either you or your friend. </p>
