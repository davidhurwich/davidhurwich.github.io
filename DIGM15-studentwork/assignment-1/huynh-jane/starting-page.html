                <p class="story"> You and your group of friends decided to go on a camping trip for 2 days out in the
                    forest near your university. The camping ground you guys chose was extremely cheap due to the
                    campground’s lack of clients. When your group settles down to start a board game to end the night, a
                    loud noise was heard that came from outside the cabin. You and a friend decide to investigate the
                    noise. To your horror you see a masked woman holding an axe standing near the vans with all the
                    tires slashed. The woman slowly turns his head to face you and your friends. Your heart skips a
                    beat. An unforgettable night begins.</p>
