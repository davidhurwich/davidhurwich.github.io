                <p class="story">Running further into the forest seems like a safer choice as the serial killer might
                    try to check all the buildings first. One of your friends follows you further into the forest.
                    Adrenaline courses through your veins and your breaths becomes shorter in exhaustion. After 20 min
                    of running, you find a small cave you can maybe hide in to take a break with your friend. You guys
                    sit down on a couple of flat rocks further into the cave. You almost feel ready to run further to
                    put more distance between you and the camping ground when a huge yawn echos through the cave.</p>
