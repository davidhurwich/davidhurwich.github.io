                <p class="story">Seeing that the bed has a narrow space that you can barely fit inside, you decide to
                    crawl
                    underneath the bed. Just as you reached the dark end underneath the bed against the wall, the door
                    to
                    the room creaks open. You hold your breath in fear. The shuffling in the room gets closer to the
                    bed,
                    and you slowly run out of breath. You try to silently take a quick breath, but dust gets stuck in
                    your
                    throat and you cough. The room becomes silent.</p>
