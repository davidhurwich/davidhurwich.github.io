                You pull the rope out of your bag, and lasso a nearby tree. You use the rope to swing forward. “WOOOO HOOO---” <em>*crack*</em> The tree branch breaks and you fall into the stream with a <em>THUNK</em>. That’s got to hurt!
            </p>
            <p>
                You cut your walk short and head home with a broken spirit and probably a broken arm, too.
