                You arrive at the forest, breathe in the fresh air, and begin your walk. The morning light streams through the tall trees that surround you. In the distance, you hear the sound of water as it rushes down a nearby stream. </p>
            <p>
                About a mile into your walk, the path splits. A signpost in front of you calls the left path “Rainbow Trail” and the path on the right “Sunshine Trail”.

                Which path do you take?
