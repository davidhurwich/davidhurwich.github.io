      You go west and use a rope to climb down the side of the room. Suddenly you notice large human bones scattered along the ground!
        </p>
        <p>   
       You hear loud growls and suddenly see a giant bear! The bear runs towards you and attacks you with it's giant paw.
        </p>
        
          <p>   
       The last thing you see before you die is a giant paw swipe across you face and the smell of fish breath
        </p>

        Better luck next time!
