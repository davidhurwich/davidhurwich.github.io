       You climb down into the first chamber room. It's pitch black, so you light a latern that you brought.

            You notice large bats flying around the tops of cave and feel the drops of condensation as it falls from the ceiling 
        </p>
        <p>   
          You see three openings, one to the west, one to the north and one to the east. Which one will you take?
