            You go east and climb up into a room. It has a skeleton laying in the middle with a sword by it's side, pretty creepy! You wonder if there are more things like this to come.
        </p>

        <p>
            Eventually you see that you need to lower yourself down to the next room. There appears to be an old rickety wooden ladder that seems to be almost eaten through by insects. There also appears a thick vine, but can it hold your wait?

        <p> Which will you choose?</p>
