    <p> You go north and enter into a large cavernous room. All around you see giant statlites growing down from the ceiling. 
        </p>
        
            <p>
                
                Eventually you come up to a large dropoff. The dropoff goes down what looks like miles. 
            </p>    
           <p>
               You see three rope bridges that have been made with loose battered rope and old rotting wood planks.
           </p>
           <p>
               Which bridge do you want to use to cross the chasm?
