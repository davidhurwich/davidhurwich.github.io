    <h2> The Sword Room</h2>

            You climb down the rickety ladder. Rung by rung, praying the old wood holds on. By a miracle you make it to the bottom of the ladder into a empty cave room.
        </p>

        <p>
            You see a sword that sits in the center of the room. You pick it up and it reads, "property of Seadog Cerebus". Hmmm, it must have been his sword. You must be getting close. You notice that on the sword is engraved a Greek Cerebus, the three headed dog of Hades.

        <p> Up ahead you see a light leading to another room</p>
