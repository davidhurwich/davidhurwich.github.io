    <p>I found the vector unit a but more challenging and complicated that the raster because it required us to create something from scratch. I was inspired by a cartoon character "True and the Rainbow Kingdom: that my 4 year old daughter loves to watch. I turned my daughter into a cartoon character similar to her and incorporated her in a scene. She has a print of this in her room loves that she is a cartoon.  </p>
