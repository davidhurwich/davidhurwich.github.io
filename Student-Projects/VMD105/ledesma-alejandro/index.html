    <p> Welcome to to my VMD 105 gallery. My name is Alejandro Ledesma and I'm an elementary school teacher in San Francisco. I have been teaching 5th grade and 2nd grade for the past 10 years. I am currently on a work sabbatical for the entire school year and have been taking courses to learn somethig new. I am taking VMD 105 because of my interest to learn the Adobee Suite, especially Photoshop. Other classes I am taking are a video editig, swimming, yoga, and tennis. </p>
