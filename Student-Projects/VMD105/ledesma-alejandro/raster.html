    <p> My first raster project was inspired by the beautiful state of <a class="ex2" href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Guerrero,+Mexico/@17.5892303,-102.3401372,7z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x85cb6558f327203f:0x3137229b4277cb3a!8m2!3d17.4391926!4d-99.5450974">Guerrero</a> where I went to a week long folklorico dance conference to learn the dances of that region.  I included the Amusga dancer with a more meztizo dancer to showcase the diversity of the region. I added texture to the background with the intricate emroidery patterns you would typically see on the <a class="ex2" href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huipil'>"huipil"</a> of the ladies in the region. The vield picture in the background are the faces of the 43 teachers that were kidnapped from the small town Ayotzinapa in 2014. It is a tragedy that has lingered in the minds of the residents of Guerrero and the citizens of Mexico. </p>
