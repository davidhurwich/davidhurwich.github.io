  <h2>[About Raster Project]</h2>

  <p>This was the first project we did for the class. It was done using Photoshop. The goal was to combine several images into one image. The requirements included adding text, a frame, and at least two images.</p>
  <p>
    I took a selfie of myself and placed myself over a videogame location. I think put a text box over it with text in it to emulate a Snapchat photo. I then placed that image on a smartphone screen to "frame" it. After that, I placed the smartphone
    on a coffee table background to make it appear as if I just sent someone a "snap". </p>
