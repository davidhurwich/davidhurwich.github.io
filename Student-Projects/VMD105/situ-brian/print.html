  <h2>[About Print Project]</h2>

  <p>This was the fourth project we did for the class. It was done using InDesign. The objective was to create a mini portfolio showcasing all the work we've done up to that point (<a href="raster.html">raster</a>, <a
      href="vector.html">vector</a>,and <a href="motion.html">motion</a>,). Other requirements for the project included having a master page, at least two different typefaces, at least two paragraph styles, and having a bleed element.</p>
  <p>
    What I did for the project was create a series of "trading cards" that had both a front and a back. One side would have an image of one of the projects and the reverse side of it would contain a brief description of the project. I think I may
    have missed points for this project by not including paragraph styles. </p>
