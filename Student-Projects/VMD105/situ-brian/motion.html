  <h2>[About Motion Project]</h2>

  <p>This was the third project we did for the class. It was done using Animate. The objective was to create a unique animation with layers containing type, sound, and at the minimum 4 motion tweens.</p>
  <p>
    For this project, I tried to emulate the look and feel of a tactical RPG game. An example of what I'm trying to emulate can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/aDYsHT45qec?t=98">here</a>. </p>
  <p> This was definitely my favorite project to do. It was so fun to the point where I lost track of time when I was doing it! Although I wasn't able to get it exactly how I wanted because of my current skill level, I am still happy with the final
    result. </p>
