  <h1>[About Me]</h1>

  <p>Hi! My name is Brian Situ. I was a Psychology and Sociology graduate from U.C. Davis in a distant past life. As a Psychology and Sociology graduate, I focused on Youth Development at the Boys and Girls Club of San Francisco.</p>
  <p>I then moved on and became a medical assistant/patient care coordinator at San Francisco Surgical Medical Group (they specialize in the colorectal field).</p>
  <p>I did not enjoy these positions and decided to move on and try something new. I decided on Visual Media Design. Unfortunately for myself, I currently don't have a set plan on my future and is currently living for the day rather than for the
    future. I am now working towards a Visual Media Design Foundation certificate from CCSF and will see where I go from there. </p>
