  <h1>Fun With Photoshop!</h1>

  <p>
    The first real project we completed was a Photoshop raster piece we were called upon to put together. We were to use imagination and display some of the skills and techniques we picked up in class.

    I have a wild imagination and am fascinated by the extremes in Mother Nature as well as fantastic themes typically associated with fantasy, sci-fi and horror. So I went with it. The Lava Fiend is none too happy with the author!
