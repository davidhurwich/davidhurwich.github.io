  <p>Hello to you, I’m Abel! You’ve just entered my website where I’ll indulge myself in showing you
    some of the things and projects I learned about and put together for VMD 105. Check it out now
    that you’re here!
    I took VMD 105 as it was required before taking more courses in graphic arts here at CCSF.
    Learning basic computer skills and gaining entry level knowledge on print/layout, Illustrator,
    Photoshop, etc. is crucial to me and my pursuit of a graphic arts career. I am deeply interested
    in sequential art and everything it takes to produce massive amounts of quality content. So,
    here I am at CCSF where I’m well served in my endeavors and soaking up as much knowledge
    as possible!</p>
