        The Motion project was my favorite thing, but there was so many things going inside my head of what I wanted to do. There were so much things to do but this was the first time
        I had to animate for a deadline, normally I would just do quick sketched animations and get it out there for my friends to see, but the . For this, I storyboarded just 
        4 cuts of the train scene from Spirited Away the Studio Ghibli movie. Hayao Miyazaki is a beast director/animator who I’ve looked up to for a while, so I did a bonus lab from 
        when we did the Vector project and did it on the character “No-Face” and got my idea for this project. The train scene was an amazing scene so if I could possibly do something on it that would be awesome. 
        TL:DR 2-D I just love 2-D animation and we can talk all day about it!
