        This was the project I struggled with the most since this was the newest program I had to learn that I previously hadn't had prior knowledge for. The Master Pages was 
        very difficult for me to handle as It would really test your skill on how to navigate Indesign and it shows a testament of what you really can do with printing for Indesign.
        In all honesty, this is my worst project that I've done but happily learned Indesign and what it does espeically for exporting specifically the package folder and how it 
        creates a main folder containing items that a print house needs in order to finalize prints. In addition to learning what Spot colors can do over CMYK colors, It provides
        special colors for your print provider. Basically giving colors that are not made from CMYK, but needs to be bought from companies that are specialized in producing them. 
        TL:DR Indesign gave me challenges but learned the most from!
