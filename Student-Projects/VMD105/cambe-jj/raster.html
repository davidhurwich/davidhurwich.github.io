            The Raster project was a fun and great introduction to the course as i’ve been using photo editing tools for a while now. The new stuff that I‘ve learned: like the selection mode,
            converting RGB to CMYK, etc. were all an amazing introduction to the course. With what I wanted to do for this project was something with neon/retro color schemes especially with that synthwave type of music and as my branding as a Twitch Stream.
            This was originally to show the type AMV/retro edits that were on Youtube and the many different apps I’ve used to make these kind of edits instead of manually doing it.
            Overwall was a fun project to do and delve deep into to get everything sorted.
