    <p>
    Hi y'all! My name is Jared (I like to go by <b>JJ</b>) Cambe and this website is to show off the work I've done for this class: Visual Media Design (VMD105). A lot of things 
    happened and taking this class made a hobby of mine to become a future career! As you can probably tell by the theme of the site, I am a big fan of Anime, Video Games,
    clothes and designing so hopefully you guys enjoy!
    </p>
