            The Vector project was a tedious process for me to do as a concept because of how new I was to the pen tool. Originally, Pokemon is having its 25th anniversary this year (2021) 
            and I wanted to pay a homage which was to do a vector anime sihlouette of Trainer Red from the Pokemon game "Red" and "Green". At first, I had made a concept of framing it with 
            the Gameboy overlay, but it didnt look decent enough for my eyes. I also included their 25th logo of Pikachu since it is their mascot alongside,
            the color scheme that I used for the whole project, which was something I had seen on the internet so I wanted to include the swatches I used.
