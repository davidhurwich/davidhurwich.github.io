    <h1>Visual Media Design 105</h1>
    <h3>Welcome to my portfolio homepage</h3>
    <p>Hi I'm an international student taking Visual Media Design 105. This webpage shows my work that I made in class. Me and my cat are best friends, so you can see that most of my work has my cat as my inspiration. Now I'm interested in becoming a UIUX designer. So I will pursue classes that will help me achieve my goal. My hobbies include watching animation cartoons, playing videogames, listening to music, cooking my own food, and gardening at home.</p>
