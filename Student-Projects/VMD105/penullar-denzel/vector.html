    <strong> Vector </strong> is artwork made up of <strong> points, lines, and curves that are based upon mathematical equations </strong>, rather than a solid colored square pixels. This means that no matter how large or small or how close you zoom in on the image, the lines, curves, and points remain smooth. The Image I provided above is a finished project that I did using Adobe Illustrator.

  Animal Crossing is a simulation video game series developed and published by Nintendo. In Animal Crossing, the player character is a human who lives in a village inhabited by various anthropomorphic animals, carrying out various activities such as fishing, bug catching, and fossil hunting. I chose to highlight this game because the new animal crossing game came out as of March 2020.
