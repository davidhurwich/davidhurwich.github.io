      <p>This is my final assignment for the Animate portion of the is course,
        I had a lot of fun working on this project. I can see myself using
        Animate more in the future. Although there was some trial and errors
        when working on it, it definitely helped me better understand and
        clarify any confusions I had in Illustrator. I love hamsters and I
        thought it would be a cute idea to have a Tom and Jerry style animated
        scene so I tried going for a more cartoon feel to it, and this is what
        I came up with.</p>
