          This is my final project for my Illustrator Vector assignment. When I
          had first started this prject I wasn't exactly sure how I had wanted
          to proceed with it, I didn't go with my original idea as planned but I
          kept changing it as I went through the project, and I'll admit that I
          am somewhat satisfied with the final results. I had trouble with using
          pen tool and crating organic shapes because I did not like the way came
          out whenever I did it so I had just resorted to using the shape tool to
          create my character. My inspiration for creating this project was to have
          a motivational and inspiring message from me(my cartoon self) to myself.
