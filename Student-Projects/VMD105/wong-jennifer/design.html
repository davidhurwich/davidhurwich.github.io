      <p> This is my final assignment for the inDesign portion of this course, it
        is a brochure that I have created containing all of my previous works as
        seen in the other sections of this site. For this design, I wanted to go
        with something both simplistic and cute, so I went with a scrapbook type
        booklet, there's a mix of both polaroid and postcard style. Although I
        feel like there are difficulties reading it, I had initially thought it
        would be easier to view this as a physical design rather than digital.
