In the photoshop portion of VMD105 we learned the basics of raster graphics. For the final, we needed to take all the techniques we learned and put them to the test with a photograph composition. I was inspired to make a fantasy photo as a gift for my significant other during Valentineâ€™s day. I used a fantasy forest background, our photograph selection, found a lovely pair of earrings someone made on pintrest, and created a brush drawn ellipse frame to contain the scene. I struggled most with the photograph, as my camera is not very good - There was some pixelization on the legs which I blurred in attempt to make it less apparent. I have been practicing with Photoshop more since then - but less with photography and more with drawn images.
