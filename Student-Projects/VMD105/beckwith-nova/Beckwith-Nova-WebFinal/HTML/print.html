During the In Design section of VMD105 we focused on print layout and learned how to set up a print project. I have used this program a few times since then for style guides in other classes and will likely continue to use InDesign a lot in the future. It makes setting up pages and elements so simple and allows a lot of flexibility in design. The use of master pages were probably my favorite for this section as they allow you to create a layout that can be used on multiple pages and make changes quickly to all of the content created within the master. Master pages make consistancy a breeze! For the final we created a multi-page document showcasing all the sections we had previously completed.
