We learned about vector graphics and how to use Adobe Illustrators basic functions. I really enjoyed these tools and have been practicing building shapes and compositions by creating paths and exploring the tools available in this program. My inspiration for this piece was simply to experiment with less geometric shapes and more organic curves. I tried to use opacity and gradients to make the fairy feel more “a part” of the scene as if affected by the ambient light. Overall, the vector final was quite a challenge but I have been practicing a lot since. I am quite fond of vector art now and think it will be incredibly useful in logo creation in the future.
