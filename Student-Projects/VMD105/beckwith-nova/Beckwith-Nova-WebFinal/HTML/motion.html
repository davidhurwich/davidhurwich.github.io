<section>
<p>
In the animation section of VMD105 we learned about the basics of using Adobe Animate and the different animation types. I really like this program, yet I do think using it well will take much time and practice. The final project for this section was to tell a short story using some basic techniques we learned in the previous weeks. My concept was a lonely orphan who wished on a shooting star and became a constellation. I made all the animated assets in vectors graphics using Illustrator and included a starry raster background.
