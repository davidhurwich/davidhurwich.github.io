Hi there! My name is Nova. I am an avid gamer, motorcycle enthusiast, Twitch streamer and a student at CCSF. I am currently learning digital skills to pursue certificates in Animation and Illustration to add to the 2 associate degrees I have in an unrelated field of study. After many years, I decided it was finally time to do something with my artwork and creativity. I have done a little bit of freelance work on branding and identity for some small business owners and commissioned tattoo work in the past.

In VMD105 I have learned the basics of Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, Animate, InDesign, as well as basic HTML and CSS. This course has been awesome, learning the foundational skills for each of these programs has opened an entire toolbox of instruments that I can use for content creation, building skills for the future. I could sing praise to this course at CCSF and its instructor all day - it is well worth the time and effort.
