    For this project I started over a lot of times. I got pretty lost in single lines and not being able to join them and change colors. I also asked my rad friend JJ if I could use his photograph. What an honor! The donuts I took from the Bob's website, there was a random photo of a random wood sign someone made for them. Looked perfect in the silly way I was after.
