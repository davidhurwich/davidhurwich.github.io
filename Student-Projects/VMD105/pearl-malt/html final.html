    <h1>Hello! My name is Pearl Malt</h1>
        
        
        <p>Here is my website with the projects I made in VMD 105. I had a challenging time focusing on a computer during and after the fires in CA. Once I was able to snap out of it, I really tried to catch up and stay positive. Really glad I didn't drop this class. Once doing my coding homework it dawned on me how much I loved coding as a bb tween and this could be a good direction for me. I love flowers, tea and UFOs. Most of my work in this class was inspired by The X Files. Enjoy!   </p>
