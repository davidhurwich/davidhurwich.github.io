            Animation was one of the section were
            everything felt new to me. This was the
            one project I needed to spend most
            time and energy to creating something.
            I'm happy that I now know the basics in
            Adobe Animate and I'm excited to try to
            make simple animations out of pattern
            I've designed. This final project was
            based on the previous vector project and
            the idea was to make the jungle feel alive
            and having a bird interact with the cat.
