            <span class="lead">My name is Ida,</span> I am 30 years old and I have lived in San Francisco with my husband since 2017. I am taking
            this class to develop my skills in different creative tools to someday become a surface pattern designer or a
            graphic designer. This is my final projects in Web Layout for
            the VMD 105 course 2021 that will showcase what we have
            done during the semester. My inspiration for the portfolio was to try
            to keep it simple with some personal details with focus
            on the different projects. I have only used html and css a few times before, many years ago, so I was really excited to refresch my memory. Enjoy!
