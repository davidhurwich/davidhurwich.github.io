    <p> For my <b>Adobe Animate</b> final project, I decided to show the process of a tree growing. I created motion tweens for the clouds, birds, sun, and a shape tween for the background so it looks like the day is changing. I created the tree by drawing a little bit of it for each frame making it look like it’s growing as time goes by. I wouldn’t say this project was too difficult to make but I did have to go back to the modules just to see how different things are done. I initially wanted to add more to the background but I felt like too much was already moving so I ended up leaving it as just the tree and some birds.I also added some bird noises on top of the music.  </p>
