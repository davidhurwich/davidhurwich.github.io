        My name is Pei Ling! This portfolio will showcase my final projects for adobe photoshop,illustrator, animate, and indesign. I had a lot of fun getting creative with my ideas and seeing them come to life. There were a few platforms I have learned previous to taking this class and it was nice to revisit the basics. There were also platforms I found rather complicated but after continious practice, I was able to a better understanding on the different tools offered.Go ahead and take a look at my work and let me know what you think! :-)
