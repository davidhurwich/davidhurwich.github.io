      <p> For the <b>Adobe Indesign</b> Final project, we focused on Print Layout. For this final project, I wanted to showcase my previous projects through a minimal design template. I was able to create an idea I initially had in mind but some things I would fix for the future would be making sure all of my text and photo boxes are centered properly. I do wish I had more time to get creative with the layout of each page but I am still content with how it turned out. Overall, this project was really fun to do and I really enjoyed recapping and showcasing the final projects I have done.  </p>
