        <h1> My first animated project </h1>
        <p> After the final animation project I started to respect animators even more. It is a very time consuming process. To simplify and save time I used objects I created for the Illustration project. I didnâ€™t know how to move and rotate parts of objects imported from illustration as one single element. For that, I had to change the position of eyes, hands and legs in illustration and import them in animation in different frames.
