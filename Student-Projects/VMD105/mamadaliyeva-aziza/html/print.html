        <h1> My first print layout project </h1>
        <p> I thought the parallels between the older technique of printing and having to think about bleeds and margins was a good introduction to the more modern concepts behind web design. I'm most interested in web design so having a good foundation is important to me. I wanted to make sure I applied my aesthetic eye to the design here, especially when trying to link together the very different styles of my different projects.
