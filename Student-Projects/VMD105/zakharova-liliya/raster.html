    <p> The first project on raster graphics challenged me to create a self-portrait in Photoshop. I have used the program before, and I really enjoyed working with familiar software. I learned to use several tools that I have not been familiar with prior to taking the class. I am very happy with how it looks.

    My raster project was inspired by my desire to travel and explore the world. So far, I have been to 30 countries and 5 continents, and I am very much looking forward to new adventures!</p>
