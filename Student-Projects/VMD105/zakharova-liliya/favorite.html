    <p> My favorite image in the whole world is a painting titled Constantinople by Paul Signac, a French Neo-Impressionist painter. I was very fortunate to see it in London at one of the annual Impressionist sales at Christie's auction house. The photo does it some justice, but it is difficult to find the words to describe how mesmerizing it is in real life! Each little bit of color was placed on a canvas as a separate brushstroke, which made the painting look like a mosaic shining with all the colors of the rainbow. </p>
