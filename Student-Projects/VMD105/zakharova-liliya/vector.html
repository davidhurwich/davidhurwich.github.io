    <p> The second project on vector graphics was to create an image using Adobe Illustrator. This was a bit trickier, as I have never worked with this software before. It was great to learn something new, especially since it has some very useful real-life applications in logo design and allows for creation of very crisp shapes and curved lines. I am excited to continue working with it.
