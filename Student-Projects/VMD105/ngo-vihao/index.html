    <p>
        Welcome to my website for Visual Media Design 105!
    </p>

    <p>
        My name is Vi Hao, this is the last project I do in this class. These projects are the sum total of all the projects I worked on this semester. I choose to take this class because my major is Graphic Design at ccsf and I will switch to Sfs with my major being Visual Media Design. This last project is also the one that I find most interesting although it is quite difficult for someone with a poor memory like me. I hope I will do well on my class projects.
