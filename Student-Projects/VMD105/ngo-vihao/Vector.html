    <p>
        For my Illustrator project, I want to create a scene in a village. The image I drew was a stranger who suddenly appeared in a deserted village in the evening. This man is drawn with a smiling mouth that seems to be thinking about some cruel plot. I didn't draw the eyes because I drew the hat that covered half of the face to create the mystery and create the malice of the character. By "Hi, Kids", I mean that the main target of this strange character is children and it seems that he wants to find the children in the village.
