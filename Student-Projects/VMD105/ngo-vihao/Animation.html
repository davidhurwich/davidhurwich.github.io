    <h1>
        _Illustrator_
    </h1>

    <p>
        The Animation project, I followed the creepy idea again, but this time it was a bit cute. I use a character of death walking on the road to perform my mission is to find people to lead to the place of the gods. I also used the mystic nebula in the illustrator project to continue the story of this mysterious character going to find children with his goal. When two people meet, they only greet each other because the goal of both is not the other.
