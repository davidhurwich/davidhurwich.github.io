    <h2>
    In Too Steep
    </h2>
    <h3>
    <p>
One of my favorite hobbies is skateboarding. So for my Raster project, I portrayed the link
between the steep hills in San Francisco and some skateboarding culture. It was difficult for me
to find a photo of someone actually going down a steep hill facing the right angle I wanted, so I
had to crop in a photograph of someone pushing on a flat surface, into one of San Franciscoâ€™s
most notorious hills which is at the top of Kearny Street near China Town. The incline is even
greater in person!
