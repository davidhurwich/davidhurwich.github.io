        <p>Hello guys! Welcome to my first website! My name is Mila and I'm from a small country called Moldova. I have been in San francisco for a few years and it's my favorite city ever! I'm very passionate about dancing as I used to be a professional dancer back home. I love baking, especially healthy goodies, adore reading and have always dreamt about my own library. One of my favorite activities are jogging, swimming and hiking. I also love travelling and used to be a flight attendant. I love exploring my limits and develop myself in all the aspects of my life. I'm studying to become a graphic designer and I'm also interested in interior design as well. Hope my journey will be amazing and I'll get the best of it. </p>
