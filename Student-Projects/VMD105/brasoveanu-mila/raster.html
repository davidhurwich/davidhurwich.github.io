<p>
    Here is my first art work in photoshop. At the beginning seemed to be impossible to create it but learning more about the program, gave me more confidence and knowledge to succeed. I did enjoy it as you can do fenomenal things and create really amazing works using photoshop. It took me at least 7 hours to finish it as I usually pay attention to all the details and tiny small things that I believe are crucial. Very happy with the result as it reflects my style of art, my work and effort I put into it. And I do believe that our limits are only our minds!
