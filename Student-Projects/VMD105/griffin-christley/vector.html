            I pretty much knew instantly what I wanted to do when it came to the vector project. I wanted to fill in the empty spaces in my raster project and what better thing to fill in those spaces than to have two portraits of the characters selected like in real fighting game character select screens. One thing I definitely didn't expect was the rest of Flygon to show because I thought it would cutt off due it not being in the canvas.

            First I knew I wanted one of the characters to be the 'Monster Hunter' against someone else, ultimately I went with 'Flygon' from the Pokemon series because it had a simple design. I tried a few other ideas before I went back to the select screen, once I tried to make something out of a corner of a wall. Then I made the final sketches of the poses the characters would be in.
