    <h2> As this was my first photoshop project, my concept was not very good and needed to be improvised more. What I intended the message of it to be was for people who like games like me to experience the outside world more and that if we were to go outside, we would just do what we always do which is just play games, but my delivery was very poor. If I have the chance to redo this project, I would have chose something that is easier for me. </h2>
