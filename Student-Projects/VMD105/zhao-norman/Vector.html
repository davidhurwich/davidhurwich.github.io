    <h2> I had a lot of fun designing this character as I was making it with the intention of animating him in the future. I got the idea to draw a turtle hating turtle from watching my favorite youtuber, Michael Reeves, who is a turtle hater. Due to current events, he may not be animated, so unfortunately I may never give life to this turtle. </h2>
