<h2> This is one of my favorite youtube videos and is one of the reasons I wanted to learn to animate. Growing up I watched a lot of cartoons and animes so I got interested in how animations were created and I stumbled upon this video. I really like Alan Becker's stick figure animations and if I were to do animations, I would want to start out doing stick figures since I am not that good at drawing.
