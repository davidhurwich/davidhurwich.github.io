    For the raster final project I was trying to go
with something simple that I could apply all of
my knowledge to. There are three main pictures
combined. The challenge for me was making
sure that the resolution of the seperate pictures
looked good together. I used the lasso tool a lot
for this project because I felt it had the most
control. I also used the add and subtract function
to make small adjustments to the selected areas.
