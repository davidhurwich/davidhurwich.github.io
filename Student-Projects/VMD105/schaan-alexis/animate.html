        This is not surprising but the Animate project
took me the most amount of time to create. I
used almost all motion tweens in this project.
I did not draw anything specifically inside
of Animate (besides the handcuffs) it was all
made outside in Photoshop and Illustrator.
The only thing I wish I knew how to do was
move the limbs of my rooster. Although, I do
think it turned out well and it makes people
laugh so I am happy with the end result.
