        <p>
            My college career so far has been a journey. I started wanting to major in
Astrophysics, then Information Secuirty Systems and now I am majoring
in Animation. The reason why I am taking this course is to learn the
basics of adobe programs. My career goal is to be an Animator and work
on superhero movies or animations. My career dream is to start my own
comapny similar to Marvel (big dream I know!). For this assignment I am
using various type faces and each type face depends on itâ€™s positioning. I am
also applying basic skills we learned in class such as use of master pages,
page markers, paragraph and character styles and linking photos to be the
proper resolution and color space.
