    The purpose behind my rooster picture is actually
kind of an inside joke. A long time ago my friend
showed me a picture of a sign saying “chicken
security force” and I thought it was funny because it
could come across as the chickens being the security
force.

It actually took me a long time to make both the
rooster and the sign in the background. What I did
was create a template of a real rooster and then use
the pen tool to outline it. I also used pathfiner a lot
to combine certain layers and parts.
