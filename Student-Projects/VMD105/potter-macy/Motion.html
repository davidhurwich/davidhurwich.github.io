    <p class="description">This was my Animation Project for my Digital Skills class, I was really excited to be able to animate Moo Cow and make him come alive. Animation so far is the most challenging for me, and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to get a feel for it and practice. I don't know if I will dive into animation deeper after the difficulties I had, but who knows what the future holds! </p>

    I made this flipbook for my Design Fundamentals Class. I really enjoyed the drawing aspect of it. It was actually quite therapeutic after you made the templates because it becomes pretty straight forward.
