    <p>This was my photoshop project and it was mostly based off of things I liked, for example the car is from a famous anime called
      Initial D and the guy inside it is singing karaoke. The Monster Energy is a joke from my friend who was addicted to the stuff. (Who is still currently addicted) </p>
