        For my time based media project I was motived by the events of the election to create an animation <br>that would get people motivated to vote and laugh at the same time. <br>

    <br> I used many different vector images and had to edit the music and various sound layers to create my animation.  <br>
     
     <br> I enjoyed getting to have a tie in with Van Halen since Eddie Van Halen had <br> passed away just around the time that I was working on the animation.
