            Entering Tropisueño feels like being recieved at an ongoing mexican party. 
            
            The festive dressed servers take  you to your table, which can be comunal or not, and leave you with a vast menu of options to choose. 
            
            I tried having the order of tacos, which comes with two items plus rice, beans and tortillas to make the tacos yourself. 
            
            My choices of tacos were beef barbacoa, carnitas and I ordered one extra one of al pastor to try it out. 
            
            I found that most of their meats come in larger chunks, even the barbacoa and carnitas. The meat was pretty juicy and the tacos were a nice handul. Not too big not too small. 
            
            Overrall the tacos are a nice treat, but if you go in looking for a taste of Mexico you probably won't get it there. 
            
            However they do offer vegan and vegetarian options that are equally as delicious. 
            
            I would consider this place a great hangout spot with your friends while in the city.
