            Just a taco loving person that is on the conquest to find the best taco.
            As someone who grew up in Mexico, tacos were one of my day to day things. 
            Moving to the US made my taco loving heart (and belly) slowly die, until I thought of trying to find the best taco. Now I get satisfied by trying to figure out what brings me close to home, and I will gladly share that with you.
