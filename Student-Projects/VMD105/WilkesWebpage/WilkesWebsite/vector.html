        Adobe Illustrator is another application that has alot of possiblities for creativity. Getting the hang of the application and trying to make a detailed shape was pretty tricky for me at first. I attempted to create a Yeti-like creature. This was inspired by my fondness for surreal and the not-so-serious art. Is the Yeti a real creature? Maybe. Maybe not. If it is, I imagine it’d have a big party in the middle of nowhere with all of it’s Yeti friends.
