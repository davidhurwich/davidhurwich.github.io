        <p>Most of the art I do is based on drawing and painting a lot. I'm always interested improving and portraying subjects in a realistic composition. It's a huge challenge to make a charcoal drawing this realistic and drawing from the painting print. But I did have a lot of fun reflecting the light and shadows all over the model.</p>
