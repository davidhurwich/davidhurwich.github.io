        <p>I like taking pictures of skies and clouds around evening and mornings. What makes it a breath-taking view is seeing a lot of  unique and dramatic colors together and seeing them change behind the clouds. I'm not into photography much but whenever I'm at a good place with a great view, I have to take a picture! </p>
