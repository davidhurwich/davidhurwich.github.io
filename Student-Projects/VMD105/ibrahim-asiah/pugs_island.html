    <p>This is my printing project with a pug's face on a flag. The theme behind this project is to create a nation's flag as if I were to build my own nation. My nation would be a small island on the Pacific coast and it has a very unique character. The island has pugs everywhere. Pugs can do what they want and population is more than 600 and maybe 200 humans! A very small island but the pugs are all loved there! And It's a Pug's Life. </p>
