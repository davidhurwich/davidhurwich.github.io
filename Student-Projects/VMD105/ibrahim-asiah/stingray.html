        <p>This is the image created from Illustrator. I wanted something ocean theme and knew I want a stingray for this project. There is an element for a dream-like fantasy; s stingray is flying through the clouds at night. I chose background for night time with stars and clouds. I do feel the clouds can be similar to ocean waves so the stingray could fly throuh them.  </p>
