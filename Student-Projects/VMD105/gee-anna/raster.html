        <h2>Raster Project</h2>
          <img src="images/raster.jpg" alt="Photoshop Project">
            <p> This was the first project of the semester. At this time, I was still pretty new to using Adobe Photoshop but my skills greatly improved along the way. The star of this piece is my dog, who just so happens to be a work of art himself.</p>
        <h2> Original image </h2>
          <img src="images/start.jpg" alt="Original Photo">
            <p> This was the original image I had started with. As you can see, I manipulated nearly every aspect of this image to create the final product.</p>
        <h2> Thumbnails </h2>
          <img src="images/rasterthumb.jpg" alt="Raster Project Thumbnails">
            <p>These were the thumbnails I had created for this raster project. I decided to go with a mix of sketch 1 and sketch 2, which was really ambitious considering my beginner skill level.
