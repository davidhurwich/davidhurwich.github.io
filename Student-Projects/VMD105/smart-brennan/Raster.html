        <p>For my project in Photoshop I decided I wanted to combined my <b>photography </b>life/with my 
       <b> Design</b> Life. What I did to create this work is first I setup the shot so I could take a self portrait. Then I took the photo, edited it in Lightroom Classic. After I edited the photo I brought it into Photoshop where I started my design phase. For this desing I took the photo so I would be looking slightly upwords to create the work I created called Spacing out!
