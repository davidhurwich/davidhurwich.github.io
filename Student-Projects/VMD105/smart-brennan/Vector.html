    <p> For my project I also Decided I wanted to do something that means something to me. So the story Behind this project is a phot that was taken of me by a professional Photographer, This was my first big time photo in skateboarding! So I decided to  Illustrate the photo by taking  me and the obstacle and drawing it!
