        <p> <b>illustrator project:</b> This project is the most challenging one in Adobe artwork, because it is difficult to draw every shape to create
        the entire character. The idea about this project
        is “traveling alone” because I like to travel, this artwork can represent my future goals. I think one day I will try to travel to some place by myself. </p>
