        <p> <b>Animate project:</b> This project is one of my favorite artworks in Adobe, because I can create a short story
        through 2D animation. Knowing the basic skills of the animation is very interesting for me. There- fore, I try to made a short animation about the “ninja fighting”. I made three of the different scene changes for ninjas because I often watch movies about ninjas and they always fighting at night, so I want to try to make an animate version about them. </p>
