        <p> <b>Photoshop project:</b> This is my final project for Photoshop, the idea about this project is "escape the world" because this year we are facing the Covid pandemic and a lot of people dead from this disease. Also, there are some areas are facing fires, many animals and people are lost there home. Therefore, I created this poster to represent the situtation in the world right now and my idea about this moment. </p>
