     Illustrator / Vector Artwork 
    </h1>
    <p>
     For our Vector assignment, we were asked to create a character in Illustrator. I wanted to make a creepy creature more appealing. I love the desert so the scorpion came to mind. With itsâ€™ mean looking pinchers and terrifying stinger, we are immediately intimidated, overwhelmed by our Neanderthal instincts. But with a little reassurance, and a flash of his anime eyes, Scotty the Scorpion is here to make you rethink your assumptions about this daunting desert dweller.
