 <h1>
     Animated / Time-Based Design 
    </h1>
    <p>
     Animation was very intimidating for me in
the beginning, but I feel accomplished when I watch this short piece. I wanted to replicate the feeling of a road trip, what it’s like to look out the car window and ponder the landscape. I loved the idea of creating the different movement (aka parallax) speeds of clouds, mountains, fields, trees and other vehicles as you pass them. Bringing in the ‘Lord of the Rings’ quote only felt natural once I saw that the truck seemed boring and empty. I don’t think I will ever do animation again, but I’m glad I gave it the good ol’ college try.
