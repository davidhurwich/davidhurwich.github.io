        Hello reader! I am Miranda Hollingswood and this is my website for VMD 105. I have lived in San Francisco half of my life, but am originally from Sydney, Australia, and I visit often. Visual Media has always interested me, and I majored in Cinema Studies for my undergraduate degree at SUNY Purchase in New York State. I do photo editing for my job where I create marketing and product photography material, and wanted to learn some new skills in design. I am very glad I chose to study at CCSF and gane some new skills while the pandemic took away other opportunities.

    This is the first time I am making a website from scratch and it is challenging and exciting. I am going to present my recent work to you, over multiple disciplines. I hope you enjoy, and have a great day!
