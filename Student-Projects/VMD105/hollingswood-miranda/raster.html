     Photoshop / Raster Artwork 
    </h1>
    <p>
        I have more experience in Photoshop than other design software, but always used it to enhance realistic photos. I was excited to create a more abstract work, and took inspiration from satellite photography of the places I am from: Sydney, Australia, and San Francisco, USA. The textural elements of cogs and chains were also important to the piece. Even the flowers have personal meaning for me. I hope you can see the work as an explorer in a cave looking at jewels, or an astronaut looking at environmental devastation as it occurs.
