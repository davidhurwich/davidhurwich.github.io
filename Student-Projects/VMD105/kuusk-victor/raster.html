    <p>
        Every journey must begin somewhere, <br>
        And in my case it was learning Photoshop. <br>
        I was already somewhat experienced with it, <br>
        Having messed around with similar programs in my free time <br>
        Despite that, I still learned some new functions and techniques it had. <br>
        My first project was to creatively alter a photo of myself, <br>
        and so of course I made surrealist image <br>
        with a deep sounding quote: <br>
        It was fun.
