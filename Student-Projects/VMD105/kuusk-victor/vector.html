    <h1>▀▄▀▄▀▄ Weird Angel Jellyfish: ▄▀▄▀▄▀</h1>
    <p>
        After using photoshop we moved on to illustrator<br>
        This was relatively new to me, but thankfully it was similar enough <br>
        to photoshop that some of the skills carried over. <br><br>
        For the illustrator final assignment <br>
        the second verse was the same as the first: <br><br>
        What's better than one surrealist image with a quote? <br>
        Two surrealist images with quotes. <br><br>
        Only this time I used a weird angel elephant jellyfish, <br>
        instead of my weird creatively altered face.
