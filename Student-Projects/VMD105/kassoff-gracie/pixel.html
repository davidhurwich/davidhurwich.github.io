            My raster final project for VMD105 (above) was initially inspired by the last 7/8 months with my partner. It’s a plethora of images of us/him depicting all the craziness and memories of the end of 2020 and some of 2021. (Yet another overlay cluster collage)

            I absolutely love working in Photoshop, be it just basic global edits, or kind of crazy collages. I’ve always really enjoyed making overlay collages that are - to put it nicely, visually ‘a lot’ to look at. 
            PS is also really useful in a photography sense. I’ve been taking pictures since I was 3 and I love being able to workshop and edit them on such a scale. 
            I took a Photoshop class within the photography department during a prior semester and really found that I loved working with the program. It was fun to get to use it again in this course.
