            Initially, working with illustrator was rather challenging for me. I didn’t find the Pen tool and points/paths to be intuitive in any way. However throughout doing the labs and assignments found myself more confident and comfortable within the program. i definitely plan to learn more in Illustrator.

            For my Illustrator final project (above) I decided to construct a vector fox. When I was growing up, my nickname from a few friends was foxx and I’ve always loved foxes. As much of a process as constructing elements within Illustrator can be, I definitely enjoyed myself. The background picture being from a hike I’d taken right around the time seemed like a perfect setting :’)
