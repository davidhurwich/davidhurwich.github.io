         <h2>My Motion Final Project</h2>

        <p>
            Overall, working with Adobe Animate was challenging. I struggled a lot with tweens/tweening initially and found myself consistently frustrated. It was in our individual midterm check-ins/meeting with Professor Hurwich that I got some clarification and tips, thus I had more of a flow by the time we reached our Animate final. Iâ€™m actually pretty happy with how said animation turned out.

            For this project, I took a raster image from my Photoshop course final project and used it as the background/Base. I then found that I could tween certain aspects/items within the original raster file which ended up being a fun process to play around with. (granted they could become symbols)
