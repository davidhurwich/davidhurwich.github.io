      Here is a screenshot from my motion project. Here I have made a small loop
      that can play over some of the music I made with my friend. We call
      ourselves limewire and this has became our new image. I was inspired by my
      childhood on Newgrounds and also downloading music on Limewire. If you can
      somehow still play .swf files, go ahead and <b>click the image</b> to view the
      animation with sound.
