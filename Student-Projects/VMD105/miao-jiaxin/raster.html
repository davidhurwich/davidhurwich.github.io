      When I was asked for making a raster project with selfie, the first scene that came to my mind was the war scene of "Game of Thrones". There are many soldiers and dragons in the war. I always fancied I could be in it. Therefore, I used a dark castle picture as the background, select two awsome soldiers and dragons, and put two clouds under two sodiers, finally put myself in it. I really like my raster project, even though this is my first time to select pictures by using lasso tool in Adobe Photoshop.
