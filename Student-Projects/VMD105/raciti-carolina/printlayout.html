<p>
In Design was another program that was mostly new to me. I think is the most complete project, except for the web layout, because it joined all of the previous projects and then used the tool to make a printable layout.  This projects needs a lot of organization, because you need to make sure you have the images and the files linked to the pages, or that you embed them but then you can't modify them, so it's tricky.  The good part is that at the end you can run a pre-flight check list and the program can tell you if you are missing anything, or if you have any errors, it even suggest some solutions. I don't usually print but it would be cool to do it for something really special.
