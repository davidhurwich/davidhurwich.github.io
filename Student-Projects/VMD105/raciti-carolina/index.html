Hola! Bienvenidos! Welcome!  This past semester I have been taking a phenomenal class at city college.  The name of the class is Digital Skills for Visual Media, and I am super excited to share my work with you.  Also, I have to give credit to our patient and detailed teacher who helped us navigate this class online.  I realize is not the same as if we were all in person and there was extra work an effort to put all the content together!

You will find a brief compilation of all the work done with each program.  I know I need a lot of practice but this class has given me a great foundation with these tools that will set me up for upcoming classes! Thank you for checking out my work!
