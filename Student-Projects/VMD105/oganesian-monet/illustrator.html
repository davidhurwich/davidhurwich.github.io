    <ul>

        <li>Not use to drawing with paths and anchors.</li>
        <li>I cannot control the weight of the paintbrush as oppose to holding a physical one.</li>
        <li>I am not sure yet how I feel about image tracing.</li>
        <li>I still have alot to learn, so </li>
        <li>Maybe I will think otherwise</li>
        <li>during my time at CCSF.</li>
       
    </ul>
