I love the idea of Animation, but it takes me awhile to get the technical skills down. Having assets ready made it way more effeicient.
<strong> I had the most fun doing my project, “Happy Little Bear.”</strong> 
I wanted to create my short live
videos of a stuffed animal into cartoon form. I am not that great in illustration, so drawing the Bear took me FOREVER, but his hair is on point.
