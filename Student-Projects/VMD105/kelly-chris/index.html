            My name is Chris Kelly. I'm currently enrolled in the Visual Media Design department at City College of San Francisco. I've been drawing and designing for most of my life and I wanted to develop the skills necessary in order for me to introduce my artwork into a digital format. So far this semester, we have worked with applications such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Animte, and InDesign. You will be able to check out my projects that I have done with each one of these apps. It's been a fun semester and I look forward to diving deeper into these apps next semester!
