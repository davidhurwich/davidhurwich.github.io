            Here is my project that I made using Adobe Illustrator. I've always liked drawing cartoons and comics and I was able to take a common character of mine and put it into Illustrator. Both Illustrator and Photoshop have a lot of similiar functions and toolsets. However, I did find it a bit harder to use than Photoshop. I'd really like to keep improving my skills at Illustrator. Illustrator was also extremely helpful when I was designing my next project in Adobe Animate.
