            Here is a project I did with InDesign to showcase all my work that I've completed in class this semester. I enjoyed working with Photoshop, Illustrator, and Animate much more than I did with InDesign. However, I think that knowing your way around InDesign is an extremely useful skill to have. Though it is not as creatively satisfying, it is great for laying out files and documents to make the presentation more aesthetically pleasing.
