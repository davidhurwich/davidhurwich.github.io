            Here is my project that I made using Adobe Animate. This was definitely my favorite project of the semester. Like I stated on my Illustrator page, I've always enjoyed drawing cartoons and have always wanted to make some sort of animation with my characters. This project was the perfect opportunity to do just that! I used Illustrator to draw the alien and the spaceship as well as the comet and the ground. It actually took me more time designing the characters than it did creating all of the motion tweens that happen throughout this short video. Overall, I really enjoyed working with Animate and look forward to learning some more about it in the future.
