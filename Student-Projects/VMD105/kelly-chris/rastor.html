            Adobe Photoshop was the first application we worked with this semester. It was a little overwhelming at first but I feel like I caught on pretty quickly once I got the ball rolling. I've ended up using Photoshop to create designs for some of the my other school material. I got my inspiration for this project because I constantly find myself staring out my window, where I spend most of my time these days, zoning out or daydreaming. Adding a layer of outer space that I'm looking out onto seemed very fitting.
