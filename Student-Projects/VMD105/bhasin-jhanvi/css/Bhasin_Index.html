        <p><font color="#000000">Welcome to my website where you get to see my work I have created through multiple Adobe programs using Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign for my Digital Skills for Visual Media class. The reason I took this class was so that I can develop the skiils to learn Adobe Illustrator since I love drawing and want to be a graphic designer with the focus of Advertising. Some of my artworks that I have done in this class include a collage made from Adobe Photoshop, and a character made from Adobe Illustrator. Click on the links to find out more about my artwork and how I made them though the different programs used.</font>

           <p><font color="#000000">Photoshop was a fun program to work with since there were a variety of things to experiment with, such as how to work with color, scaling and adjusting an image, learning how to use the paintbrush tool. Adding background, photos and texts. For our final Photoshop assignment we had to make a collage using pictures of our choice. We were also expected to use text to see what all we learned during the Photoshop section of the class. This was a fun program to learn as I learned alot from this section in the class</font></p>

            <h3> Illustrator</h3>
    <p><font color="#000000"> Illustrator was my favourite program to use since I like to draw and I want to work in the Advertsing industry and be a graphic designer. Using a lot of the skills that I learned in my Digital skills helped me learn how to use Illustrator, and it taught me what the basics of Adobe Illustrator are. Some concepts that we learned in Illustrator were how to use the pen tool, basics of shape builder tool, what colors you can use like, color swatch,color pallete. For our final Illustrator project we had to make a character and use text with our final character and also merge our Photoshop final to our Illustrator final.</font></p>
