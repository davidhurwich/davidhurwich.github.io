You will follow a day in the life of John, a man living on Shakedown Street, in West L.A. Looking for the heart that left this Town. You will manipulate John's actions for a day, met with challenges that suit a man of his stature.

You gotta' beat it on down Shakedown Street! Finding yourself crossing paths with an old loathed acquaintance.

As you jeer at you're opponent, they take the advantage and overwhelm you quickly. Beating you soundly, and leaving you spwralled out in the street. In your stupor you decide you've procrastinated enough; it's time to go to work.

You pass each other without acknowledgement. There are bettter things to do.

The work ain't worth much, and it ain't even honest, but it keeps food on your plate at least. As you see it compensation should equate to risk, but your employers tend to be more tight-fisted.

In hindsight you realise, extorting the mob for more money may not have been the wisest choice. Never the less you lived and died by your convictions.

You decide to keep your dissatifaction in your own head, at least then you cant say the wrong thing. Besides, if you made any more you might move away.

Work is done, and the day is getting dark. Now, though, you feel the drag more than ever. You need a room, a palace, to conduct your business. At least for a minute.

You make way for rented residance. However, you lack the nessisary funds. Despite your best attempts you are turned down and forced to vacate. What was once a dull itch has turned into an incessant pain.

You're inattentive about your surroundings. A bowl was the goal, now stymied by the wreck you find yourself in. All that runs through your mind is escape.

Looking for the next fix, tearing down the street in a blaze of tire and glory. Day's like these, they never end, they just Fadeaway.
