                You take your time and gather a large bouquet of flowers for your friend. They’re gonna love it, you think as you scratch an itch. And another one. And another one.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>UH OH</em>. You spot the patch of poison ivy you walked through to get to the flowers.
            </p>
            <p>

                Well, at least your friend will have a new bouquet to freshen up their living room. Was it worth it? Maybe. But now you’ll have to cut your walk short and go home, you're too itchy to walk straight.
