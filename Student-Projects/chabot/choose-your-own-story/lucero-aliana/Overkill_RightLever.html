                <p> Thankfully nothing trap-related happens, which given your track record for having close scrapes with icky ends via trap-related means, saves you from the off-chance that this trap probably would’ve actually gotten you this time. And hey, one of the doors in here opened, so that’s a plus too, probably. Another day, spiders. </p>

                <p> Going through the door, you find yourself in a dark and musty room, and at first glance, it’s surprisingly empty. Upon closer inspection you find that while crossing your eyes, you see that there’s actually a pedestal in the back of the room. You have to tip your non-existent hat to whoever made this arcane-dungeon-crypt-thing in the first place, that was a pretty good room illusion. </p>
                
                <p> Walking up to it still cross-eyed, you notice a slab of ancient script hanging on the wall, which thankfully you don’t have to cross your eyes to read, because this is starting to make your head ache. </p>
                
                <p> <i>"The one who wields this staff and the magical forces within, holds the key to unleashing Armageddon."</i> </p>
                
                <p> Huh, that’s kind of a blunt way of putting it, though you wonder what it means by Chicken Armageddon. Glancing over the text and some thinking, you decide it’s either a typo or misread on your part. It happens. Shrugging your shoulders you remove the staff from its case and decide to leave the dungeon the way you came. </p>
