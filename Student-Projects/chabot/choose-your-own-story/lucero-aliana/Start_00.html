                <p> As the village dentist youâ€™re known well enough by your clientele. You're good at what you do, and pretty satisfied with your career path. That doesn't mean that you lack free room for other interests, however. While it's not something that your patients might expect, these "weekend trips" you take every so often aren't so much buisness or leisure related, but your side-hobby.  You're a part-time adventurer/dungeon looter. </p>
                    
                <br> 
                <p> Lately you've heard rumors from traveling merchants that there's a newly discovered dungeon to be visited, and a legendary artifact to be found. </p>
                
                
                <p> Not long after starting your journey, you come across a fork in the road, with two different ways to go from here-two different paths to choose from, if you will. <i>*hint hint nudge nudge*</i>
                <br> Taking an idle moment's pause just perusing your options, you figure out which road looks best. </p>
