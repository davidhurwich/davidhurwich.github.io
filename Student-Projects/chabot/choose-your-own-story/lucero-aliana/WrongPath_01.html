                <p> Deciding to ignore simple logic and visual clues, you cheerfully go down the road of <i>Wrong Wrong Wrong</i>, not bothered in the slightest. Who cares if there's a small voice in the back of your head who just wants to be helpful and nudge you down the path that clearly leads to where the main story is, you're a free spirit! Dungeons with legendary arcane relics are a dime a dozen anyway. </p>
                
                <p> As the day wanes and the sun starts to set, you finally get the feeling that you possibly should have listened to. In the low fog, all these woods feel the same as the others. Unless you've managed to wander into one of those forests with shifty trees again. You might not even be as wrong as you think, considering you've been feeling eyes on you for the past hour...
