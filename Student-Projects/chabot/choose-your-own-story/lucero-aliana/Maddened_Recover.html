                <h2> A single thought of clarity reminds you that you came here to explore and bring, not bring about the Abockalypse in its full-feathered wrath. You take some deep breaths, as well as a moment to recover from you frenzied poultry-driven bloodlust. Once you cool off you realize that you've been standing in a room full of-alongside a few mutilated bodies and a generous amount of feather-covered gore-a lot of chickens. While it was all in good fun, you decide that it's finally time to head on home... But what about all these chickens? </h2>
