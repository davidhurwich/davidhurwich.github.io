                <p> As the title says, you succumb to powerlust, and a driving mad desire to use the Staff of Armageddon to bring forth a new world order. With an army of loyal murder chickens at your beck and call, the world cannot stop you now. </p>
                
                <p> The world wasn’t ready for you and your invincible chicken forces, and soon the world’s strongest kingdoms and powerheads fall at your feet. Being the benevolent maddened warlord you are, you decide to spare their inconsequential, chicken-less lives and allow them to exist under your new dominion.  A New Age Under Your Command has been written in history, and the pitiful peasants under your iron rule regard your name with both reverence and fear: The Almighty, All-powerful…  Omega Ultra Chicken. </p>
