                <p> Magical light glowing warmly in your hand, you step inside the ruins and wander downwards into the main hall. </p>
                
                <p> The hall room turns out to be livelier than you expected. Lit torches space the walls, the dim light more than enough to illuminate the roomâ€¦ as well a mid-sized pack of bandits. With a surveying glance you conclude that while most of them are soundly out cold, you can hear a few whispers, so at least one or two or still awake. Considering you have a nice fat stealth stat, stealth tactics is the obvious way to go. But how do you go about it?
