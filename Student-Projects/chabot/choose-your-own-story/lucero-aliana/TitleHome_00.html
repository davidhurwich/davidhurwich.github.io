            <p> Welcome! </p>
            <p> Don't worry, the title wasn't poured into Google Translate a dozen times. You're a dentist. In a fantasy medieval world. It's just like Dungeons and Dragons! (Minus the multi-page character sheets, initative rolls, and crit 20s of course. Oh, and also the dragons...) </p>
            <p> Oh well, this game doesn't need those things anyway. Press start to begin your adventure! </p>
