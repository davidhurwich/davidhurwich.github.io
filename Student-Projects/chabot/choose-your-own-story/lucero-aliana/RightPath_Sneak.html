                <p> Thanks to your excellent sneaking skills and expert ability to hum your own sneak montage with sneaking past said bandits at the same time, you made past without getting caught. Not only have you sucessfully made your way past the room with all the imminient danger, but you also resisted the urge to go overkill on everybody! Go you! </p> 
                
                <p> Moving on to the next room, you find that this one is about as straightforward as it gets, at least as far as dungeon puzzles. Instead of any doorways or exits, before you is a set of levers identical in appearance, with no appearent difference in use. No doubt about it, one lever will slide open some secret passageway as is all the rage with catacombs these days, the other giving way to a gruesome and terrible death. It's something you've come to expect at this point. </p> 
                
                <p> You suppose you could flip a coin, but in a spur of of the moment you reach forward and pull the lever that tickles your fancy the most. Which one do you go for? </p>
