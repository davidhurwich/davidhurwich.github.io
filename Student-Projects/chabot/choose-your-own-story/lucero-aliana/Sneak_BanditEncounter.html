                <p> Just as you're about to saite your curiosity by , a group of bandits swarm into the room. You're surrounded!</p>
    
                <p> "Oy Congrats on the find!" their leader laughs with a sneer. "You really thought we wouldn't hear your humming while trying to sneak past us, didn't ya? We's was just letting you go on by so you could find the treasure for us! Now hand it over-er, whatever it is-and we promise to only rough you up a wee bit." </p>

                <p> Well, drat. Turns out maybe loudly humming the Mission Impossible theme while moving past slumbering bandits wasn't the best idea. Well, there's no way you're handing over your brand new ancient artifact to them, but getting out of this one's going to be tricky...</p>
                
                <p> You look at the small horde of bandits around you, and then look back down at the Staff of Armageddon in your hands. </p>
