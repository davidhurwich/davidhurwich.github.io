                <p> Whistling to yourself without a care in the world, you stroll out of the musty dungeon the way you came. As the light meets your eyes, you get an odd sensation. For some reason that you can't quite explain nor comprehend, you get the feeling that, somehow, something very different was supposed to have happened back there... perhaps, in another playthrough.... </p>
                
                <p> Eh, you think to yourself, it must be a false sense of déjà vu. Not giving it another thought, you dismiss it and cheerfully heads on your way home. </p>
