                <p> Suddenly realizing the opportunity you have here, you grin with glee and hold up the staff in the dank dungeon air. As it glows with a sinister scarlet aura, the smarter of the bandits get a hint of what is going to happen next. Unfortunately you canâ€™t quite recall exactly what happens, as you plunge into a giddy fit of madness and unleash the Staff of Armageddon on the poor fools. The only things you can clearly remember afterwards is the horrified screams and cries of anguish, a frightening amount of gore and lots and lots of merciless chickens. </p>
                
                <p> Once the room clears and everything else previously living has been pecked into nothing but bloody stains on the floors wall and ceiling, you look into the glowing orb of your staff, you realize that you are its rightful wielder. Suddenly, it all becomes clear. </p>
                <p> There is a decision to be made. </p>
