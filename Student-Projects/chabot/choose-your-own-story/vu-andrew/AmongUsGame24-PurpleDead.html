                <p> The Oxygen room is in sight, but you see something sticking out from the wall. It looks like something purple. Purple does have a mini purple astronaut buddy with them, so maybe it's them. What you thought was the purple buddy was actually... <strong>PURPLE'S DEAD BODY! </strong> Better report the body! </p>
