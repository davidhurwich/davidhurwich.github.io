                <p> You look at Green and calmly say <br>
                    <strong>You</strong>: No, if you were innocent you would have reported the body immediately. But, I saw you stand in fron the body for a few seconds and then turn around to see mee spot you. This was self-report, everyone! <br>
                    <strong>Orange</strong>: Well, it is possible that he could have self reported. It has to be one of you two as no one else was there as a witness. We'll vote green first, and if it's not him, we'll vote green immediately. Who is favor of voting Green off? <br>
                    <strong>Everyone</strong>: *raises hand* <br>
                    <strong>Green</strong>: Ya'll, don't be stupid! Black is lying about- <br>
                    <strong>Orange</strong>: Sorry buddy, but you gotta take one for the team.
