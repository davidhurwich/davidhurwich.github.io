                    <p> Good job! You convinced your fellow astronaut pals that <strong> Green </strong> was an imposter! Good thing that you went into the Medbay, <strong > Blue </strong> really helped you out there! Now everyone seems to trust you and Blue more! Maybe <strong> Orange </strong> is good too, but there is no way to say for sure. Anyways, get back to those tasks!
