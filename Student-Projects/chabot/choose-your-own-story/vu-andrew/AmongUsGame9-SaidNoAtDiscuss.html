                <p> You look at green with disbelief. <br>
                    <strong>You</strong>: No, I didn't kill White! Green did it! <br>
                    <strong>Orange</strong>: Honestly, you are both pretty suspicious. However, I think it's more likely that it is Black since he is being defensive with no evidence to back him up. Who is in favor of voting him off first? <br>
                    <strong>Everyone</strong>: *raises hand* <Br>
                    <strong>You</strong>: W-wait! But I saw him kill in that hallway! You'll lose if you kick me off!!! <br>
                    <strong>Orange</strong>: Sorry eggs, you gotta take one for the team. </p>
