                <p> You decide to tell everyone where you had found the body first.<br> 
                    <strong> You </strong>: So I found Purple's dead body in the Oxygen Room. His little buddy was sitting next to his body, the sight made me shed a tear :( <br>
                    <strong> Orange </strong>: I want to say that I was in the camera room, and I did see Red walk away from the Oxygen room. There's a good chance that it is him and now Black. <br>
                    <strong> Red </strong>: Now hold on a second, how do you know it's me and not Black? He was also in that room! <br>
                    <strong> Orange </strong>: Are you really arguing with the dude on the cameras? Everyone, let's vote him off. We all know Black is innocent.</p>
