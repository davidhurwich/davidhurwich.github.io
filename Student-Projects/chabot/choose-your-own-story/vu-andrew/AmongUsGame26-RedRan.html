                <p> You decide to tell everyone that you saw Red pass you in the part of the hallway near the Weapons room.<br>
                    <strong> You </strong>: Everyone, I happened to pass by Red on my way to the Oxygen Room. He came out of the Weapons Room, which was nearby Oxygen. If he was not the killer, he would have reported the body, but he walked right passed it! <br>
                    <strong> Orange </strong>: I trust Black on this. He and Blue are definitely innocent, since they correctly identified Green as an imposter. I say we kick Red out of here. Everyone in favor, please raise your hand. <br>
                    <strong> Everyone </strong>: *raises hand* <br>
                    <strong> Red </strong>: Wait, you're making a mistake! I saw Black kill Purple and self reported! <br>
                    <strong> Orange </strong>: Hey, you gotta take one for the team. Besides, this is a decision we can afford to make. No hard feelings.</p>
