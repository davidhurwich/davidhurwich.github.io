        <h1>Greet the Merchant</h1>
        <p>You and the cart meet along the road, it's a traveling merchant.  You stop and chat with them for a little bit.  After some pleasant conversation the merchant offers you a look at their wears.  A small amulet, made of reddish metal and shaped like a triangle.  You find it a very appealing trinket.  The merchant offers you a chance to buy it, along with other supplies. If you want to. </p>
