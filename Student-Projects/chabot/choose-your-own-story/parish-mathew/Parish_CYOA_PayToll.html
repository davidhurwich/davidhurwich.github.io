        <h1>You pay the toll</h1>
        <p>You drop ten gold coins into the rocky hands of the troll.  It gives you a warm, stony smile and offers you a meal in the building.  You politely decline, not feeling hungry and eager to get to the city.  You pass by the troll and continue on your journey. <br><br> 
	    As you walk along the cobbled road you start hearing the sound of metal clanging against metal.  Coming up on the road you see a group of dwarves battling with a mechanical construct.  A clockwork soldier.  The dwarves appear to be winning.  You can try to lend a hand, run around the conflict, or wait and watch. </p>
