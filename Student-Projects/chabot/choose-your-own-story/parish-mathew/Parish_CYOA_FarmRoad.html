        <h1>Taking the Farm Road</h1>
        <p>You've spent a fair bit of time adventuring and enjoy a bit of excitement.  You take the north road, in spite of the danger.  The slightly overgrown from lack of use but you keep moving.  Breathing in the fresh air and the smell of the crops being grown at the nearby farms.  A few hours into your journey you hear some groaning.  You see what looks like a dwarf laying on the ground just off the road.  The dwarf is shaking and the groans appear to be coming  from him.  He looks injured will you help or move on?</p>
