        <p>You decide it's best to let them escort you to the city.  You don't feel safe with those Duergar around.  The guards walk with you to the city and you all have a tense but pleasant time.  The patrol explain what happened to the gate guards and you're ushered into the city walls safely. <br><br> 
        Well now that you're here it's time to find an inn and rest.  You've got business tomorrow.</p>
