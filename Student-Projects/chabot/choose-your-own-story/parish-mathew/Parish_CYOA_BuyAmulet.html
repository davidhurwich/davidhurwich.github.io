        <h1>Buy some stuff</h1>
        <p>The amulet is very pretty so you decide to buy it and some extra supplies.  You pay the merchant and you both wish each other well.  You continue your journey.  As you travel it starts getting dark, you decide to make a camp.  After setting up your tent and eating an enjoyable dinner. <br><br>
	    When you finally sleep that night your dreams are disturbing.  You see a plane of red sand.  Devilish beings fly across the sky above you.  Some small, other large.  You feel a deep rumble shake the ground beneath you and a voice booms through the sands.  “The contract is accepted.”  <br><br>
	    Then you wake up.  </p>
