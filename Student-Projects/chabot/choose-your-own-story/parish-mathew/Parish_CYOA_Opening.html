        <h1>Arriving at Serde</h1>
        <p>After a successful trip through Krode you have made it to the country of Serde via Fort Thorn.  After submitting to a search and examination you are being allowed entry to the small state.  You haven't been to this country before and could ask for directions on your way out of the Fort or you could just leave and let the road take you.  What will you do?</p>
