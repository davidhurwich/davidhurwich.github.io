        <h1>Decline the Help</h1>
            
        <p>You respectfully decline the escort to the city.  You have never enjoy traveling with others and don't plan to start now.  You wish them well and continue on your way.<br><br>
        You arrive at the city gates alone.  It's getting late and there are four guards stationed at the gate.  They are suspicious of you and refuse to allow entry.  The guards tell you to turn around and used a different gate.  You could try to bribe them for entry though.</p>
