        <h1>The Crossroads</h1>
            
        <p>The guards wish you safe travels as you leave the Fort.  Barely a five minute walk from the fort you make it to a crossroads.  A signpost is embedded in the grass with multiple languages telling you the directions.  To the north it says “Farm Road” with a piece of parchment nailed to that sign saying “DANGER.”  Pointing east is a sign saying “To Serde.”  Someone carved a holy symbol into it.  Pointing to the south is a sign that says “Trade Road.”  It doesn't look modified. </p>
