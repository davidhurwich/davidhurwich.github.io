        <h1>Ask for directions</h1>
        <p>	You step up to one of the guards posted by the exit and ask for directions to the City.  “First off, don't take the northern Farm Road,” he says, “The guard has been working hard to stop the Duergar incursions but they're still ambushing people from time to time.  If, for some reason you decide to take that road, try to find a guard patrol.  They'll escort you to the city.  The guards at that gate won't let you in otherwise.  <br><br>

        The main road is the fastest but people don't like using it as much anymore after those hellhounds appeared.  The hounds are gone now but folks say it corrupted by the devils of hell and to walk the road is signing your soul away to them.  I don't agree but that's up to you. <br><br>

        The southern Trade road is definitely the safest.  The Dwarves at the mine have regular patrols and there's a rock troll guarding the bridge at the river.  You just have to pay the toll to cross.  You can also spend the night at Dwarftown.  I warn you though, their nightly parties get incredibly rowdy.”</p>
