        <h1>Run Away!</h1>
        <p>The fighting is focused on the road so you decide to run slightly north, following alongside the river.  You hear more clanging of metal and some explosions.  Probably the guns on the automaton.  One loud bang goes off in your direction and then there is nothing but darkness. <br><br>
	    You probably should have waited.</p>
