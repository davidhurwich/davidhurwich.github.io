        <p>You smile and wave at the merchant as you walk away.  They do the same. <br><br>
        As you continue on your journey it starts to get dark.  This route takes more than a day to reach even the outer city.  It seems that you'll have to make camp.  You set up a tent and prepare a decent meal.  You have a relaxing sleep and make for the outer city in the morning. </p>
