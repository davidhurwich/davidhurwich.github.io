        <h1>The Trade Road Bridge</h1>
        <p>You turn south and head to the Trade Road.  You have to cross the bridge over the river.  When you reach the bridge you see it's built along side a large house that also spans the river.  A huge rock troll steps up from under the bridge.  It stands on your path.  As you approach it says, “Hallo!  Welcome to the lands of Serde.  If you wish to cross this bridge there is a fee of ten gold coins to be paid up front.  If you wish to rest here for a time I can offer you food and a bed if you need it.”  What will you do?</p>
