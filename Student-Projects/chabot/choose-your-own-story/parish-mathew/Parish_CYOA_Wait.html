        <h1>Wait out the Battle</h1>
        <p>You crouch behind a rock giving you good coverage from the battle.  You peak out every once in a while as the battle progresses and after around ten minutes of waiting the dwarves have brought the clockwork soldier down.  They even took the extra step to disable it's self destruct.  You watch them bandage their wounds and salvage parts from the destroyed machine.  After they're all finished, the dwarves start walking the same direction you're going.  You follow along with them.  You hope that you're close enough to yell for help but far enough away to hide if another fight starts.  <br><br>
	    The rest of the journey is uneventful and you arrive at Dwarftown safely.</p>
