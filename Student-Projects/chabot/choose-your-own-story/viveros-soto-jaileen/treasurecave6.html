                    A cave bigger than their imagination could have ever possibly imagined. So ominous, so dark, so ancient looking cave. As if it was a haunted house coming to life looking for whom it may devour.

                    Hazel being the person who loves old creepy things wanted to go in and explore. She felt that good feeling of adrenaline that gives you chills all through your spine. That feeling made her want to find out the history behind that strange-looking cave so she decided to go in and solve that mystery.
