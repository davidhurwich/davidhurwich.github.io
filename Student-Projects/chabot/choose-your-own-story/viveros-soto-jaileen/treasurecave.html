                    Three very adventurous and exploring best friends decided to go on an adventure and get out of the city to enjoy a day out in nature. Hazel was the most exploring and brave one of the group, she loves creepy places because she finds them full of history. Geraldine is the adventurer and curious girl in the group, she always wants to make good memories that she can go back and tell her family and friends. Vanessa is the calm and overthinker who loves to explore but always has to second guess herself and really think about her next move before doing it.

                    Where will they end up? Will they survive or die?

                    You will decide what paths they take. Are you down for the adventure?
