<p>You decided to stargaze in the city and lost count of time. You look at your watch and realize it is already 2:00 AM. You start walking back to the subway station and realize you might not make it in time taking the regular route. You look around for a cab but see none. You decide to go through the alley as you know it will save you some time and will probably make it in time.</p>
