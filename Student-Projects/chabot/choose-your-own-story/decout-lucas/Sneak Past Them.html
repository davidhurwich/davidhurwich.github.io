            You start to sneak around the Skeletons leaving your crew close behind in case you get in to some trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you sneak around the side your foot slips on one of the small patches of dirt. The skeletons are instantly alerted but your crew jumps in to the fight to help you out. You guys have cleared the skeletons with ease and are going to dig up the treasure.</p>
