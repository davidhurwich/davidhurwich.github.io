                "Goodbye," said the fox. "And now here is my secret, a very simple secret:
                It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is
                invisible to the eye." "What is essential is invisible to the eye," the little
                prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.</p>
