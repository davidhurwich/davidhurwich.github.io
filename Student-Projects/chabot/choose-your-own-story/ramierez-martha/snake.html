            <h1> The Snake </h1>

            <p> I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall−− and I leaped into the
                air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow
                snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even as I
                was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step
                back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the
                sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry,
                disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.
                I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face
                was white as snow.
                The little prince said;
                "I, too, am going back home today..."</p>
