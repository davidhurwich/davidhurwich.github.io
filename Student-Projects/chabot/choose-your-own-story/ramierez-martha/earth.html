            <h1> Earth </h1>

            <p> The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there 111 kings
                (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000
                geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000
                conceited men−− that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown−ups.
                “People where you live," the little prince said, "grow five thousand roses in
                one garden... yet they don't find what they're looking for... They don't find
                it," I answered. And yet what they're looking for could be found in a single
                rose, or a little water..."</p>
