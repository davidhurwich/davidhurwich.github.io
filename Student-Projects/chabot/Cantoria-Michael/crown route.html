        <p>You stumble into a dimly lit room and see a glowing chest in the center. You approach it slowly and use your torch to shed more light around the chest. You set the torch down and decide to open the chest. Opening the chest, you find a gigantic sum of gold coins, enough for a king. You take what you can carry and exit the dungeon. </p>

        You win!
