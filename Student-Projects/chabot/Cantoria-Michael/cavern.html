        <p>You enter through the mouth of the cave and into a cavern network. Though a little dark, glowing mushrooms help illuminate the cavern. You continue to explore until you hear the sound of a large creature walking around. You quickly hide behind some rocks and take a look around and see what was making all the noise: a dragon. The dragon seems to be looking around as well, possibly being awakened from its slumber. The dragon then begins to speak, saying “I know you’re here, human. Come out and face me”. As the dragon comes closer, what do you do?</p>
