        <p>Taking the arrowhead route, you make your way down a long corridor. A faint streak of light emanates from the ceiling and you walk towards it. As you come into the light, a volley of arrows are shot from the sides of the walls and you are hit by them. You quickly succumb to your injuries and perish. </p>
