        <p> You and Lucy arrived at the park. You gather the things you brought while Lucy picks out an empty spot. Locking your car, you walk towards Lucy where she's standing on an big empty spot near the pathway.</p>
           <p> “Do you think this is a good spot?” Lucy asked </p>

            <a href="adventure_yes%20(lucy).html"> <button> Yeah! This spot looks great! </button> </a>
        
            <a href="adventure_no%20(lucy).html"> <button> No, I think there's a better spot over there </button> </a>
