            <p> You briefly explain the memory while Lucy cuts in from time to time to give her intake of the memory. Many laughters and discussions later, the sun begins to set. You and Lucy begin to pack everything into the basket and walk back to the car. </p>
            <p> “Today was really fun, I had a great time today” Lucy said </p>
            <p> “Me too, thanks for coming out today” you said </p>
  <p> You pack everything to the car and drive Lucy home. </p>
            <p> You pull up to their house and walk her to the front door. Both of you stare at each other for a bit. </p>
            <p> “So… Do you mind if I ask you out on a second date?” you asked </p>
            <p> “Yeah, I would love to go on a second date” Lucy replied </p>
            <p> You both said your goodbyes and drove home happy. </p>
