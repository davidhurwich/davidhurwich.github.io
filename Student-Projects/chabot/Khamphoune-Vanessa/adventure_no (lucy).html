            <p> Both of you walk down to an area where there’s a bunch of flowers that are in bloom. </p>
            <p> “I hope you’re not allergic to flowers” you said </p>
            <p> “No, I’m all good here” Lucy replied </p>
            <p> You put the basket down and grab the blanket that’s inside to spread it down on the ground. Lucy helps you take out all of stuff that’s in the basket. They noticed two items that weren’t food related and picked up both items. Item one was a laptop and item two was a deck of Uno Cards. </p>
            <p> “Oh, those! I brought it with me in case you wanted to watch a movie or play a couple games of Uno while we talk” you said </p>
            <p> “Okay! You choose what we should do” Lucy said </p>
