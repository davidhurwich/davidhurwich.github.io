        <p>You get lost in the forest during hiking. You are alone, and your phone got dead battery. There is no way to send out any message. You are a photographer, luckily, your camera still works. 
        <p>As night started to fall, you want to find a shelter and get the supplies you need to survive in the dark. You also want to find a way to send out a message to get rescued.  </p>
