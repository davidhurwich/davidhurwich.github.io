                <p>Hm, right. It's late, and I have work first thing in the morning. Someone has to pay bills! So, maybe I should rest on it and call it a night. I can always resume in the morning after gaining some clarity through my sleep. </p>

                <p>We shouldn't jump to conclusions after reading one article tonight. We can't be certain this "Nick Harley" cult is even true. This could be fake news for all I know.</p>
