                <p>Morning, sleepy head!</p>

                <p>You wake up and get ready for work to start the new day. Getting in those full seven hours of sleep, sleeping like a complete baby. Woo-, you must've been really tired! Now, time to brush our teeth and get dressed.
                </p>

                <p>Come on, no time to waste! I have to get through morning rush on BART. You know how busy it can get this early in the morning.
