                <p>Suddenly, there is an abrupt knock at the door. Who could that be? No one is around the neighborhood at this hour; it's almost 2:30am. This can't be good news. But then again, SF is always full of surprises. As a Bay Area native, I know at least a thing or two about these kinds of things. (You build a certain tolerance over the years.)</p>

                <p>Should we check it out and see who's at the door?</p>
