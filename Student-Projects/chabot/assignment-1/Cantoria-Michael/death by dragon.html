        <p>Despite getting the jump on the dragon, you are barely able to scratch its scales at all. Once the dragon finally notices where you are, it pins you down with its claws before it incinerates you. Just like previous adventurers that treaded the dungeon, you join them in their nameless failed quests.</p>
