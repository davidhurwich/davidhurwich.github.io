        <p>You enter the dungeon and quickly see how dark it is inside. You decide to light a torch to help with visibility. You can see on the walls that there are certain symbols. The symbols are placed above the entrances of two different corridors. One symbol resembles that of a kingâ€™s crown while the other symbol looks like an arrowhead. </p>
