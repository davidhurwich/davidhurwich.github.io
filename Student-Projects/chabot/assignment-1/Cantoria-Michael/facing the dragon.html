        <p>Mustering up your courage, you step out from behind the rocks and call to the dragon. The dragon then stops and looks toward your direction before asking what you are doing in its cave. You explain your whole adventure for glory and why you came to the dungeon. Afterwards, the dragon explains it has been asleep for a few hundred years and wishes to see what the outside world looks like.</p>
