                You spot a log not too far off and drag it to the creek. With a little bit of effort, youâ€™re able to lay it across the water and make a bridge to the other side. Carefully, you balance your way across.

            <p>
                <em>Success!</em> You made it. You continue on your way. You spot a cluster of birds in the trees. Wow! How beautiful, you think.
            </p>

                Eventually, your path splits again. The left seems to open up to a curious clearing up ahead, the right has spots of color in the grass in the distance.
