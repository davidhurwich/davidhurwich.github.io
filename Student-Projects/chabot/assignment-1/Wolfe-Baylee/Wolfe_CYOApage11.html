                <em>Sweet!</em> You remembered to pack your binoculars. You spot a huge wasps nest hanging up above and you appreciate them in their natural habitat from a safe distance.
            </p>
            <p>
                When youâ€™re satisfied, you pack away your binoculars and continue on your way.

                Eventually your path splits again. To the left, there are spots of color in the grass in the distance. To the right, the path seems to open up to a curious clearing up ahead.

            </p>
            <p>
                Which path do you take?
