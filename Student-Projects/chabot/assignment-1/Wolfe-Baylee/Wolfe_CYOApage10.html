                You throw a rock and, lucky--<em>or unlucky</em>--you, you hit the strange object right on! Your celebration is cut short by the sound of distant buzzing getting louder and louder. <em>UH OH</em>.
            </p>
            <p>You run, but youâ€™re too tired from your recent uphill climb. A swarm of wasps surround you.
            </p>
            <p>
