            <p> You park your car infront of Lucy's house and walk up to the front door to ring the doorbell. The nerves start you get to you while you wait for Lucy to open the door. The door opens and you see Lucy smiling at you. </p>
            <p> "Hey you, are you ready to go?" you asked </p>
            <p> "Yeah, lets go!" Lucy said </p>
            <p> You and Lucy walk to your car and begin to drive off to the park in the city your friends recommended. Lucy connects her phone to the aux and you two start vibing to her playlist. Thirty minutes later, you arrive to the parking lot of the park. </p>
            <p> "Oh wow, I've been wanting to come here for so long now." Lucy said </p>
            <p> "Yeah? I've been here a couple of times and its a nice spot to hang around for a while and do whatever." You said </p>
            <p> You turn off the engine and start gathering everything together. </p>
            <p> "Alright, lets do this" you thought </p>
