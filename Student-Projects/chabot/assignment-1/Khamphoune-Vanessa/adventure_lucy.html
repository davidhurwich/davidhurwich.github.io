            <p> Youâ€™ve been crushing on Lucy for a while now and it seems that they have returned those feelings the more you two hung out with each other. One day, you gathered up the courage to ask them out and they said yes! Both of you discussed where you wanted to go on your first date and agreed on doing a picnic in the park to get to know each other more. Will the date end in a bust or will it move forward to a second date? </p>
