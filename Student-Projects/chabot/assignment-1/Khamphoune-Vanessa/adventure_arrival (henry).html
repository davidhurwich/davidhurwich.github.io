            <p> You park your car infront of Henry's house and walk up to the front door to ring the doorbell. The nerves start you get to you while you wait for Henry to open the door. The door opens and you see Henry smiling at you. </p>
            <p> "Hey you, are you ready to go?" you asked </p>
            <p> "Yeah, lets go!" Henry said </p>
            <p> You and Henry walk to your car and begin to drive off to the park in the city your friends recommended. Henry connects his phone to the aux and you two start vibing to his playlist. Thirty minutes later, you arrive to the parking lot of the park. </p>
            <p> "Oh wow, I've been wanting to come here for so long now." Henry said </p>
            <p> "Yeah? I've been here a couple of times and its a nice spot to hang around for a while and do whatever." You said </p>
            <p> You turn off the engine and start gathering everything together. </p>
            <p> "Alright, lets do this" you thought </p>
