            <p> Lucy glares at you for a second before talking about that day. You cut in from time to time to give intake of the memory. The rest of the date was in silence with little inputs here and there. You notice that the sun is beginning to set. You and Lucy begin to pack everything into the basket and walk back to the car. </p>
            <p> “I had a good time today” you said </p>
            <p> Lucy hesitated for a second, “yeah, me too” </p>
            <p> You pack everything to the car and drive Lucy home. You pull up to her house and walk her to the front door. Both of you stare at each other for a bit. </p>
            <p> “So… Do you mind if I ask you out on a second date?” you asked </p>
            <p> “Umm, ask me again in a week and I’ll let you know my answer” Lucy replied </p>
            <p> You both stood in silence for a bit before saying your goodbyes. You walked back to the car and drove home. </p>
