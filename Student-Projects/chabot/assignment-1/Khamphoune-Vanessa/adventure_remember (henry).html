            <p> You briefly explain the memory while Henry cuts in from time to time to give him intake of the memory. Many laughters and discussions later, the sun begins to set. You and Henry begin to pack everything into the basket and walk back to the car. </p>
            <p> “Today was really fun, I had a great time today” Henry said </p>
            <p> “Me too, thanks for coming out today” you said </p>
   <p> You pack everything to the car and drive Henry home. </p>
            <p> You pull up to their house and walk him to the front door. Both of you stare at each other for a bit. </p>
            <p> “So… Do you mind if I ask you out on a second date?” you asked </p>
            <p> “Yeah, I would love to go on a second date” Henry replied </p>
            <p> You both said your goodbyes and drove home happy. </p>
