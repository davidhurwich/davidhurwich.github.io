            <p> You wake up to the sounds of birds chirping. Looking at your alarm clock and see that it's 11am. Getting out of bed, you do a quick stretch and get ready for your date with Henry. </p>
            <p> "I got 3 hours before I go pick up Henry, time to get everything ready." you thought </p>
            <p> Your phone pings and a text notification from Henry pops up. </p>
            <p> <strong> "I just got up but I can't wait to see you later! Hope you don't forget anything before you pick me up LOL" </strong> </p>
            <p> You text him back and begin to get ready. You head down to the kitchen and prepare all the food and gather all the items you needed. Looking up from the basket, you look at the clock and see that it's 2pm. You do a last minute check of everything in the basket. After seeing all the items, you close the basket, lock your front door and head to your car. </p>
            <p> You pull out your phone and text Henry saying that you're on the way to pick him up </p>
            <p> <strong> "Okay! I just finished getting ready, lmk when you get here" </strong> </p>
