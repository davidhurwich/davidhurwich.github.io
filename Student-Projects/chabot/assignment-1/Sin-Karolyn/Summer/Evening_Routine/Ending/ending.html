            <p>What a weird experience it was to be sharing a meal with a bear. You were thinking that you had to share this odd experience with your friends.</p>
            <p>After such an eventful day, it was time for bed. You were just glad that you were able to step away from work for a bit. Next time camping, maybe you will plan to do something different. Goodnight!</p>
