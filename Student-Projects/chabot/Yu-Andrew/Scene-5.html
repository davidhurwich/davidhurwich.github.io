                <p>I dial the # to the SFPD, but no one seems to answering. I should have better signal by now. And aren't these types of things suppose to be operating 24/7? Ugh, someone on the other end is probably busy chewing on a donut. </p>

                <p> Should we cancel the call and instead do it in the morning?</p>
