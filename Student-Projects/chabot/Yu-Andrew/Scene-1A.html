                <p>Inside the envelope contains an anonymous love letter addressed to a man named <em>Nick Harley</em>, followed with a photograph of the man and possibly the woman who wrote the letter. What a mystery she must be! I wonder what happened between them. Perhaps I am now suddenly emotionally invested. We got to help this lady out and send her letter to "Nick" (assuming that he is her boyfriend)!
                </p>

                <p>Should we Google the man's name? "Nick Harley San Francisco" is pretty specific enough. Plus, I want to do the moral thing.
