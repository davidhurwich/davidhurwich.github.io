                <p>You finally arrive home and get your nighttime routine started. First, you check for any new emails and text messages from your colleagues and friends. Second, scrub-a-dub-dub away that built-up sweat while in the shower. Third, catch up on the latest news. And lastly, enjoy some last-minute Netflix bingeing before getting drowsy.
                </p>

                <p>Do you want to sleep now? You have to get ready for work in about six hours. You should be cautious with how you spend your time nowadays.
