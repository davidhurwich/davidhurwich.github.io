Story & Questions: 
It is almost midnight in San Francisco and you finally get off BART at the 16th St Mission station. You’re in a hurry to get home after a long day at work and stumble across an unopened envelope left on the ground. A few stains and wrinkles, front and back, where you can see the ink stains and specks of dirt from the pavement swirling together. It is insanely dirty and too damp to recognize anything encased inside.


Do you perform a good deed and deliver the letter to the person addressed on the envelope? Do I dare get myself involved in a stranger’s business? To be frank, you love to be noisy; you can’t help it. It all seems harmless, but why should I go out of my way to get my hands dirty, quite literally and metaphorically? What if there is money or something valuable inside? Or would you rather not pick it up at all? Whatever is inside is most likely unreadable/unrecognizable to the eye after sitting on the damp pavement. Why would I touch trash of all things? The streets of San Francisco aren’t that clean and spotless after all. So, what should you do? It turns out there is an anonymous love letter addressed to someone named on the front cover--Nick Harley. Can we pick up any clues and trace the letter back to the man’s mysterious lover?
