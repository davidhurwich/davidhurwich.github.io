                <p>It's midnight on a work day, and you're exiting the gates of the 16th St Mission BART station, desparate to go home. However, you stumble across an unopened enveloped left on the ground. Who could've dropped it? Now, it's stained and scratched all over, front and back. Should you pick it up? But mind you, San Francisco doesn't necessarily have the cleaniest streets, espeically around BART.</p>

                <p> Do you pick up the envelope and see what's inside?</p>
