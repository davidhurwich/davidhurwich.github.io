                <p>You type in "Nick Harley San Francisco" into the search bar and wait for a split second for your screen to finish loading the results.</p>

                <p>Okay, wait--that's odd. Google only had one result. How rare can the name "Nick Harley" be? It's quite American for parents to name their sons "Nick!" So why did the screen only pull up one link? Is it because my data is spotty here? I'm pretty confident that I paid my phone bill on time this month.</p>

                <p>Do you click the first link that showed up?</p>
