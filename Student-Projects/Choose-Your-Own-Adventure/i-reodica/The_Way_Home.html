            <p>After a few minutes, Terry and Orion make it to the swamps.</p>

            <p>"I'm home!" Terry leaps out of Orion's arms and splashes around in his swamp. "Thanks, Dee!"</p>

            <p>Dee nods, and as he leaves, Orion looks back on their adventure together.</p>

            <p>"Hey, Terry, I should probably get going. It was great meeting you, though." Orion's words are bittersweet.</p>

            <p>"It was great meeting you too, and thank you! You know the way here, Orion, you're welcome to visit any time. Promise you will?"</p>

            <p>Orion grins. She's finally made some friends. "I promise."</p>
