            <p>Orion remembers her mentor's words from earlier that day. They echo in her head and it's all she can think about. How is she supposed to make friends? It'd be easier to just stick to herself and stay at home. She sighs, and takes a look around. </p>
            
            <p>...Where is home anyway?</p>
            
            <p><em>"Oh no"</em>, she thinks, <em>"I'm lost. Just another thing to --"</em></p>
            
            <p>Her thoughts are interrupted by a high pitched "Woah, there!" from down below.</p>
