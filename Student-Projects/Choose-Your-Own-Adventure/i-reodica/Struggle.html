            <p> Terry was so stressed from the last time that he got all slippery and slimy, allowing Orion to wiggle out of Coriander's grasp. How lucky!</p>

            <p>As they make their escape, Coriander yells out, "No! They would've been so yummy! Every time something bigger than a fly goes by..."</p>

            <p>Orion slows down to a jog to catch her breath.</p>

            <p>"We could've been eaten!" Terry gasps.</p>

            <p>"Yeah, that was close, but we don't know where we are again."</p>

            <p> "I can use the conch and call the snails!"</p>

            <p> "Good thinking, Terry."</p>
