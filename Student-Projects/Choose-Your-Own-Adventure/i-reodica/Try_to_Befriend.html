            <p>"It must be lonely -rgh- being here all by yourself." Orion struggles against the vine.</p>

            <p>"What?" Coriander growls out.</p>

            <p>"Well, everyone who comes here gets eaten, right? You must not have anyone to talk to. But we can be friends."</p>

            <p>"Wh- I... I guess it <em>is</em> kind of lonely..." Her vines get a little looser.</p>

            <p> "We can be friends, I can visit you, and we can talk, if you just let us go so I can bring Terry home. We need to get to the swamps, do you know where it is?"</p>

            <p>Coriander thinks it over, and is moved that someone would think of her. She lets the two of them go.</p>

            <p> "The swamps are right past the River Path. I don't know them too well, though, so I can't help much."</p>

            <p> "Thank you," Terry says, "We'll visit, we promise!"</p>
