                Mr. Morgan’s eye lights up at the sight of the cooler.<br>
                “Oh my, my, this must be from Dr. Lang, finally taking responsibility”

            <p class="justwork">
                Dr. Lang?... That name seems familiar to you, suspiciously familiar. Then it hits you- Cindy Lang! your old colleague you’d been calling Euler up until now.
