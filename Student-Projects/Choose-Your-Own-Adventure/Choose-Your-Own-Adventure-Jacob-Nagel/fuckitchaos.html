            <h1> Polygondwanaland </h1>
            <p class="justwork">
                Mr. Morgan grabs the Burrito and motions to a stairwell at the back of the store, as you climb the staircase you begin to see strange shapes projected on the walls, as if light was shining through a kaleidoscope.
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                Finally you reach the top of the stairs, as you peer through the doorway your eyes meet a small glowing object sitting on the floor. While it is a polyhedron, it constantly shifted, while it seemed to be made of some kind of crystal, it shifted in shape constantly in a way no physical matrial could. Its faces and edges constantly shift and clip through eachother.
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                Mr. Morgan leans down next to it, he thanks it for it’s time in Skeksil and spends some time reminiscing about all the different citizens and their individual relationships with the being.
                Eventually after some time he gets up, looks at you, eye full of tears, and then back at the Polyhedron.<br>
                In one swift motion he strikes the it with the burrito.
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                Then white. Your vision is completely gone, and all you can see is white space, until eventually you begin to make out shapes, hundreds of them, then thousands, then… infinity. You are now floating in a sea of rapidly changing geometry, forming bizarre and wild shapes. Some recognizable as buildings and natural formations, some completely abstract.
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                Then, almost as soon as you arrived, you wake up once again, next to your girlfriend in bed. However this time she is much more pleasantly suprised to be awoken by you.
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                “Holy shit, I thought you died”
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                She jumps on you, wrapping both arms around your body in a tight embrace. You feel her shaking and both of you break out into tears. As you sit there still processing all thats happened, you look out the window to see the morning fog come in.<br>
                How long had you been gone? Days, Weeks? Does it even really matter? Probably not.
            </p>
