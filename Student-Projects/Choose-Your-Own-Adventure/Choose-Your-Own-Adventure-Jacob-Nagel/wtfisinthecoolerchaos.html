            <p class="justwork">

                Without directly responding, Morgan opens the cooler. Out from a fog of frost he produces a large frozen burrito housed in a plastic bag. Without thinking you let out:<br>
                “I’m sorry but what the fuck?”
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                Mr. Morgan places the burrito back leaving the cooler open for viewing.
                “I take it by now you’ve suspected the contents of this box are highly unusual” mogan remarks with a chuckle.
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                “This burrito is a lot more than it seems, the aura it gives off isn’t in your head. It has been imbued with incredible power”
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                For some reason, the more you find out about the situation, the more ridiculous it becomes. So you ask the big question:
                “Why is this burrito so… uh ... powerful? Ignoring the silliness of making a burrito ‘powerful’, what purpose does it serve?”

            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                Mr. Morgan hesitates, something about this situation bothers him.<br>
                “With this we will be able to rid Skeksil of the Polyhedron, and hopefully it will at least halt the deterioration of physics and release us from this seasonal time dilation”
