                Euler is disappointed but understanding. You both go your separate ways for the evening and you head home for some well deserved rest.<br>
                Your life moves on, you have a short lived marriage, bookended by the tragic death of your wife in a bus accident. Life still goes on though, as you move through romantic partners, jobs, houses, cars, clothes, you begin to feel the passage of time, and age begins to really take a toll on your body. You die at the age of 86, you leave behind many close loved ones and family. Your life wasnâ€™t an action movie by any means, but it was eventful and satisfying in its own unique way.
