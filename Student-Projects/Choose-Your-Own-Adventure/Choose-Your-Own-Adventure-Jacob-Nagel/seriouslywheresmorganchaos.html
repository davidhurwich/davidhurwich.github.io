                Suddenly the first drawer of the one of the store’s filing cabinets begins to shake and open, about a third of the creatures eyes are now looking at it. And after a couple more seconds of shaking a file comes floating out and lands on the counter in between you two. The file opens to reveal a map.

                “Well, ever since his previous shop being consumed by the void, he moved over here”
                <p class="justwork">
                    a marker floats over and circles a small shop several blocks from your location.
                </p>
                <p class="justwork">
                    “Hope you find whatever you’re looking for” the creature remarks cheerfully.
                </p>
                <p class="justwork">
                    You thank the creature for its help and begin walking over to Mr. Morgan’s shop
