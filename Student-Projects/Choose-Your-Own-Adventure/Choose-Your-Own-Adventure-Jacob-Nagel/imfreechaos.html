            <p class="justwork">
                You and your still nameless friend plan out a dinner for the evening at a nearby pakistani restaurant and both arrive quite punctually.<br>
                As of recent, Euler (the name you have internally given your friend until you figure out her real name) has been working as some kind of corporate representative. She travels across the world contracting manufacturing plants for various projects. Oddly she seems to evade specific questions about what these projects are and what company she operates under.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                After a pleasant meal Euler asks a favor of you:<br>
                “ Hey Alec, I hate to bug you with this, but in all my infinite wisdom I booked over one of my meetings a town over and have a flight to catch tomorrow afternoon. I want to have an apology package delivered over to Skeksil, but I don’t know of any courier services in town. Do you know of any?”<br>
                For a moment you had to think to remember the little town, ah yes, skeksil, a small drab city about 15 miles inland, you’d never been there, but you knew the coast well enough to have driven by a few times. However to your knowledge there aren’t any courier services that go out there.
