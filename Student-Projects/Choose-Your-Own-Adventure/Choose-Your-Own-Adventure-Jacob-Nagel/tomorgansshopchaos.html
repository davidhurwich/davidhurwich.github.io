            <h1> Morgan's Alley </h1>
            <p class="justwork">

                When approaching the shop you begin to notice something unusual, for some reason the shadows around the shop seem to be cast in the direction of the sun’s light, which not only makes no physical sense, but was incredibly disorienting.
                However the strange light phenomenon didn’t stop there, the closer to the building you get, the area would lose more and more color, slowly washing out to a grayscale when you reached the shop entrance, something was definitely wrong here.
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">

                Upon entering the shop, you are greeted by a small furry creature on the ground, you can’t quite tell what it is, and it keeps making a strange humming noise, you step over it and continue into the shop.
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                A voice calls out from behind a bookshelf<br>
                “Ah, sorry about that, don’t mind Thomas, he's just sleeping”
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                From behind the bookshelf another bizarre creature emerges. Like the others, he is tall, but he seems to have a more humanoid figure as he wears a set of coveralls. However the human familiarity stops at his shape, as his face is pale, with one giant eye, a wide grin full of sharp teeth, long pointed ears, and a set of pale horns.
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                “Well look at you, you don't seem to be from around here, Name’s Jonny Morgan, what can I do ya for?”
            </p>
