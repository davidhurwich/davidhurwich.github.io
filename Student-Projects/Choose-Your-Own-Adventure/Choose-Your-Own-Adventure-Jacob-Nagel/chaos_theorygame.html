            <p class="justwork">
                The past 5 years have been simple since you finally escaped academia. Your work in the city’s urban planning and development department has kept you just busy enough to lose track of the days as you drift from shift to shift, week to
                week, month to month.
                Your routine has been continuous and mostly uninterrupted for the past half a decade. You go to work, visit construction sites, talk to contractors, go on trips with your girlfriend, and hang out with your boys on the weekends.
                However you come home from work one afternoon and notice on your drive home you got an unexpected text message from an old colleague and classmate of yours from your days at university.
