                Your intuitions seem to have been right, you come across a shopping area and walk into the first shop you see.
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                However, the ego boost you received from feeling like your degree was actually worth something was short lived when you met with your first resident of Skeksil.
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                As you enter the first shop, you encounter what can only be described as a mass of eyes. The large fleshy creature was about 7 feet tall, 3 feet wide, and wearing a small red baseball cap. The sight of it nearly makes you faint. Never in your life have you seen such a bizarre creature, yet for some reason you feel no fear, just shock.
