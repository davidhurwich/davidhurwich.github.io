                “Uh… Hi sir-er- uh… Whats up my dude?”
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                What are you thinking? This is crazy, what the fuck is that thing? Too late to second guess now, at least 80% of its eyes are on you now.
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                The creature shifts backwards, as about half of its eyes widen in surprise.<br>
                “Oh my, we don’t get many outsiders out here, where are you from?”
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">

            <p class="justwork">
                The creature lets out a loud jovial laugh.<br>
                “So how may I help you sir?”<br>
