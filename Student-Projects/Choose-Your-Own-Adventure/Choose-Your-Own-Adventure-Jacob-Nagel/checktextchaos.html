            <p class="justwork">
                When opening the text something begins to feel off, while you immediately knew who it was from, there is no proper contact name. For some reason or another, you have your old friend listed as X=V-E+F. What's Even more odd is that you can’t remember her real name.
                You move on to the text itself:<br>
                “Hey Alec! How's it been these past few years? You still living in Maytown? I'm in the area visiting some clients and was wondering if you’d wanna meet up?”

                Before responding, you do a quick search of your friend’s contact name to see if it reminds you of her name so you don’t have to awkwardly avoid her name
