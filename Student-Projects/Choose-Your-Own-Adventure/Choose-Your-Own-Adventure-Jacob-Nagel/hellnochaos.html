                “Eh, I’m good” you say taking a step back from the cooler
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                Mr. Morgon closes his eye and nods.<br>
                “Probably for the best I suppose, Well it was nice to meet you, uhhh-”
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                “Alec”
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                “Alec! Well it’s been nice talking with you, thanks for the delivery, now I’d suggest you get on out of here, to be honest I have no idea what is going to happen when I destroy this thing”
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                You wave on your way out of the dark little store and head back to your car, and just as you leave the city limits you decide to pull over to take a look at the town from the outside, only to be greeted by a large crater.
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                Usually you’d be shocked, the lack of an explosion or debree raises all sorts of questions, but at this point none of it matters. Whatever became of the town of Skeksil and it’s residents is anybody's guess now… though most wouldn’t guess it’s demise would involve a frozen burrito and an interdimentional piece of sentient geometry.
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                You look up at the sky, let out a sigh, get into your car, and start driving home. Maybe it's time to take a vacation.
