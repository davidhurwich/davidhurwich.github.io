                Well, you’re awake now, and you go to the kitchen to make breakfast. Just as the clock strikes 7 you hear a knock at your door. <br>
                Right, Euler was going to drop that package off around now wasn’t she?<br>
                Sure enough there on your doorstep is a large beat up cooler

            <p class="justwork">
                The cooler gives you an odd feeling, like looking at a porcelain doll or old blurry photos. Something about the it fills you with a sense of dread and anxiety.
