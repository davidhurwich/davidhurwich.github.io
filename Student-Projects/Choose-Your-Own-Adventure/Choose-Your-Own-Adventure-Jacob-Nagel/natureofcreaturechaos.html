                You hesitate, but ultimately your curiosity allows you the courage to ask:<br>
                “Not to be rude, but what exactly… are you?”
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                The creature lets out another hardy chuckly, you still have no idea where it’s talking or if it even has a mouth<br>
                “Oh yes, I suspected you were new around here, well I am the shopkeeper of this fine establishment, but I’m sure you were wondering why I am so different from you right?”
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                You nod nervously. The creature continues:
                “well , at one point many decades ago I was human, but ever since the
                Town started changing, all us residents changed with it. So you could consider me human just like yourself, except with more eyes… and no limbs I suppose”<br>
                The answer doesn’t help you much<br>
                “ What caused this?” you ask
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                A majority of the creature’s eyes look up to the corner of the room, reminiscing.
                “Ah well, many years ago we received a new resident, some kind of sentient geometric shape, and ever since then, things have gotten a little… extraordinary. Is there anything else I can help you with sir?
