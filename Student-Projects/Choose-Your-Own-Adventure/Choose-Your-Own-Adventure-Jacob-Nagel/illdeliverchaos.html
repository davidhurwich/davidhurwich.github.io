                “Well, I’m free tomorrow, how about you drop the package off at my place in the morning, there aren’t that many couriers in the area willing to deliver to Skeksil anyways.”</p>
            <p class="justwork">
                Euler is overjoyed and very appreciative<br>
                “Oh man, you're a lifesaver Alec, I’ll drop the package off tomorrow at 7 then, thank you so much”<br>

                And before you knew it there you were back at home in bed. You look at the clock first, it reads as 6:30am. Confused, you jump out of bed and look outside to see the morning fog float about the coast. What happened?<br>
                One moment you were talking with your friend, and the next here you are, in your room the next morning. At this point your girlfriend who you hadn’t noticed in the bed next to you is awake, and annoyed about it:<br>
                “Dude its 6 in the fucking A M on a saturday, what are you doing?”<br>
                “I’m not so sure myself” you say.<br>
                She groans, turns over, and quickly falls back to sleep.
