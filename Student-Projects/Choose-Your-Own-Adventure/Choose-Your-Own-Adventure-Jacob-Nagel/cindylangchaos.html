                “You know Cindy Lang? I’m a friend of hers”<br>
                He gives you a puzzled look, then looks at the ground and lets out a half hearted chuckle

            <p class="justwork">
                “Yeah I know her, she brought polyhedron into town about 80 years ago”<br>
                The revelation comes as a visible shock to you as you can see your face in the reflection of Mr. Morgan’s giant eye.

                “I do suppose this is all very strange for ya” he goes on “Well like I said time doesn’t work the same way in skeksil, every change of season is a change in the rate at which time passes relative to the outside world, yer lucky that you came during the summer, only a day or so should have passed, out there, which reminds me, you should run along. or else you’ll miss a day or so more”
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                All this is a lot to take in, but Cindy’s place in it all is strangely the thing that makes the least sense. Given the unusual passage of time, it is plausible she was the one to introduce this polyhedron to Skeksil, but how and why? And how does it connect to your instance of lost time this morning and this clunky old cooler?
