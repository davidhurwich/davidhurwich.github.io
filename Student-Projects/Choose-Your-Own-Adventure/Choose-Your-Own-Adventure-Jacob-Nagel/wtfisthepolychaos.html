                “A simple question with a deeply complicated answer” Mr. Morgan continues, “It is a being of pure geometry and energy. It’s origins aren’t entirely understood, but we know it has sentience, but it seems to lack self preservation or the need for things like air or sustenance. Possibly because up until now, it has proven to be completely immortal. Guns, bombs, everything we tried was simply consumed by it.”

            <p class="justwork">
                Mr. Morgan’s Eye wanders off, gazing out of his shop doorway solemnly.<br>
                “The problem is that it means no harm, from our few experiences of communication it seems to be friendly, and in a strange way, our community has embraced the Sentient Polyhedron. But it’s existence, at least in this dimension, only means bad things. Our dimension is not structured to contain such an abstract and complex being. So our only choice now is to find a way to get rid of it”

                “And Lang’s involvement in this?” you ask.
                Mr. Morgan’s gaze snaps back to you.<br>
                “Ah yes, you seem to be in the dark in all of this, I assumed when you said you knew her you were involved in some way. Well Dr. Lang arrived in our town about 6 years ago in your time. She left it here by accident, but upon her return a few weeks later, the time dilation had already begun, and 4 years had passed inside of Skeksil, and the Polyhedron, had gained true sentience by then, and refused to leave, so she said that she would come up with a way to fix this problem. And now here you are, with the key to our woes”
