                “Ah, I take it ya been around town then? That explains your lack of shock when seein lil 'ol me, haha” <br>His smile is contagious. For a town full of twisted mutants, everyone seems to be very friendly

                “Well all this is because of this moron that moved in a few decades back, the Polyhedron. A dangerous and powerful critter. It started with time- ya might have noticed that the sun hasn’t moved since ya got here.”

                This comment catches you off guard, but after a quick look outside, the sun still sits low, despite you wandering town for at least three or four hours.

                “Oops, didn’t mean to startle ya, yep, we’re stuck in a time loop out here, nice thing about it is no one ages, too bad that wasn’t the end of Skeksil’s trouble. Every year something new seems to get all twisted up, first the animals and people began to change, we started receiving strange powers all the sudden, yknow like pyromancy, telekinesis, and all that stuff. But then our bodies began transforming, some more than others as you likely have already seen. We’ve been trying to get that damn polyhedron to move out but he's so stubborn. Plus many of us have gotten used to it all. Sure we’re all monsters and physics have gotten a little wonky, but the ol Polyhedron is part of our community now, and I suppose it’s one of us”
