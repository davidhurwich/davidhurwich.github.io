                As you turn and walk back into your kitchen the box had somehow moved from your doorstep to the kitchen table. This shocks you for obvious reasons, and you look around the house for any intruders to no avail. The only people around are you and your girlfriend who probably couldn't be woken up by an atomic bomb at this point.
