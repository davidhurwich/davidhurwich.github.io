            <h1> The Cooler </h1>
            <p class="justwork">
                The cooler is heavily used, but looking at it closer only accentuates the sinister aura it gives off. On the top it has an address and a name: Mr Morgan. You ignore the anxiety and chalk it up to your groggy brain messing with you, it is 7am after all.
                After a quick shower and a change of clothes you jump into your mr2 and dump the cooler into the back. </p>

                As you head on your way you begin to reflect on the past events
                Why can’t you remember Euler’s name? Who is she? Why can you simultaneously remember her fondly, but have no specific events or connections to draw on?
                <p class="justwork">
                    However the biggest question comes when you hit Maytown’s city limit: Why have you never visited Skeksil? You know where it is, but you’ve lived in this county for 5 years now, surely you would have passed through it once or twice. But you just can’t remember anything about the little town.
                    After about 20 minutes of driving, you reach the Skeksil city limit, the sign is dilapidated and strangely warped, despite it being carved out of stone, it was warped and hard to read. However the real head scratcher came when you pulled up to the address written on the cooler’s note, only to find an empty lot.
                </p>
                <p class="justwork">
                    However something was odd about this lot, while most open lots had their plumbing and power removed, it seemed almost like whatever building stood there was lifted out, large sections of pipe jut from the ground, shredded power lines hang all around, the neighboring buildings seem damaged, but only on the sides directly adjacent to the open lot.<br>

                    What do you do now?

                Search the town, surely some of the other residents know the whereabouts of Mr. Morgan</a>
