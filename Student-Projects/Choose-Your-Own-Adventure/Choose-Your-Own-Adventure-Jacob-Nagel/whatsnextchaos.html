                “Well, now I take this frozen burrito and walk upstairs and crush the polyhedron”
            </p>
            <p class="justwork">
                You are taken aback. The sentient polyhedron is here? Now? And he plans to kill with a fucking frozen burrito? There is no way an invincible energy shape can be killed by wacking it with a frozen tortilla stuffed with beans and rice. But as you gaze down into the cooler you are reminded of it’s aura; sinister, evil, something about the burrito is otherworldly- cursed almost. Suddenly the idea seemed slightly less absurd. But only slightly.
