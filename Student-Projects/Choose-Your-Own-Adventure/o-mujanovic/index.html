				<p>You are a bioengineer attempting to research extraterrestrial lifeforms on a spaceship traveling through deep space. Moments ago, you heard an explosion somewhere on the ship and all power has been cut. Right before the explosion, you heard someone mention a potentially dangerous entity on the ship over the telecommunications. <br /><br /> No one isÂ responding to your attempts at reaching them. <br /><br /> You decide to navigate through the ship and reach the escape pods.</p>
