				<p>You decide to enter the right door, and you find yourself in a room that looks like a simple storage room at first glance. You decide to dig around for supplies, finding essential items like bandaging and painkillers. After digging around, you notice a strange formation in the panel on the wall being covered by a large box. <br /> <br /> After moving the box, you find out that the panel in the wall is detachable and leads to a secret passage. <br /> <br /> Do you stay to gather supplies or do you go through the secret passage?
