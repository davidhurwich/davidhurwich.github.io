				<p>You gather your essentials and start making your way to the escape pods. You are vaguely aware of the direction you need to go, but everything is dark and there is rubble everywhere, making navigation slightly more challenging. You reach an intersection with two doors, and you're unsure which one you should take. One looks slightly more run down than the other, but you vaguely remember it possibly being in poor condition even before this situation.</p>
