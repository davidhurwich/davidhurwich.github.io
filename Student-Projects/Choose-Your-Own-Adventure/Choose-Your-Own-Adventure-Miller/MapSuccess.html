			You look down at the book of maps, thumbing through the pages until you find an image of what seems to be a fork in the road along with a simple messge: "When the fork in your path appears, remember to choose the right path". How frustrating, you think. Of course I must choose the right path, or I will be stuck here forever. And then it dawns on you... simply choose the path on the right.
