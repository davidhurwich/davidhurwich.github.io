			You reach a clearing in the bush leading to two pathways, and suddenly a hungry creature appears. It snarls and prowls around you, you are paralyzed in fear. As if it couldn't get any worse, it begins to speak- in a low, rumbling, terrifying tone. "I am very hungry little traveler, I have been searching these woods high and low for something to eat, and you are the tastiest looking thing I have yet to find... unless of course you have something to feed me other than the skin off your back" You stammer out a response "but please, creature, I have nothing, only this book of maps". "Maps? well little traveler, I have no desire for eating books". "Of course you don't!" You nervously begin to thumb through the book, looking for a pathway to food. You find nothing, and in your panic decide to lead the creature to the right, telling it that food is down that way.
