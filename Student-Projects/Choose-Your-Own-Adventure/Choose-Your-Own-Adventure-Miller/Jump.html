			You set the book down at the bank and plunge into the emerald pool. A wash of lukewarm fluid, just barely thicker than water, surrounds you and suspends you. You neither sink nor float- it is almost as if there is no gravity, just an ability to pass easily and swim throughout the pool. The pool appears to extend on forever like an ocean, underneath the surface of the earth above. You can either swim back up through the hole above, or try to swim to the bottom. If there is a portal or pathway, it has to be in the pool somewhere. Your chest is starting to hurt and it's becoming harder to hold your breath, choose quickly!
