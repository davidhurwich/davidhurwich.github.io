			You swim deeper and deeper until the bottom of the pool come sinto view. Your chest feels as if it may burst, but as you gaze down at the bottom surface you again see a circle made up of stones. It glows a bit. This must be the portal, the way out! You swim through the portal... and wake up in you friend's bed at the party! Congratulations Psychonaut! You have escaped the trip.
