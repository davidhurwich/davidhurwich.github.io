            You again thumb through the book, searching for clues. You find a page that displays a dead-end to a pathway. At the end of this dead-end is pictured a door, or perhaps what one would call a portal, lined in the phrase "Maps only lead to the pathways of the world it knows". You decide the only way to continue your journey is to jump in to the pool, for there is no longer a path to follow past it, and it leads only to what you assume is a world beyond this one. Maybe it is your way to get back home.
