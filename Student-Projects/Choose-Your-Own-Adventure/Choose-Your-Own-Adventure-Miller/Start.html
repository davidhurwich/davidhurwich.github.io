			Welcome to the craziest party you've ever been to. It's the first night put since quarantine ended, here's to Summer 2025! You dance, sing, and then suddenly, you feel a little sick. You make your way up to your friend's bedroom and crash on the bed... you slowly drift off to sleep...

        <p class="p2">
            A spiral... It's all you see above of you as your eyes slowly blink open. As your vision clears and adjusts to the purple hue of the bedroom, you see that it's simply a poster hanging on the ceiling above. You realize there's no longer any music playing downstairs, the muffled sounds of the party have disappeared. You look down at your hands, and for just a moment- is that <em>tentacles?</em> You shake your head. No no, those are your hands. Nothing seems real. The popcorn-foam walls are waving, ebbing and flowing, that's definitely not normal. Are you in a dream? Clearly nothing is what it was when you fell asleep. And then it hits you.
