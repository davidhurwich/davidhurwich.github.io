			You look down at the book of flora, thumbing through the pages frantically. You start to evaluate the flowers, bushes, mushrooms and trees on either path. You identify many plants leading down either path, checking to see the book if they are signs of good or bad, but you then realize... the paths have all the same elements, there are no differences between the identical paths, and you have no way of choosing the right path. You walk dejectedly down the left path, the wizard disappears behind you, and your eternal journey through the forest begins. You are stuck here forever.
