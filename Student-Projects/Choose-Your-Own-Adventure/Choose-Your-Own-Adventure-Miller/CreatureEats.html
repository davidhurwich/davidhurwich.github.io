			"You look tastier by the moment little traveler" the creature grins and begins to lick its lips... approaching you with delight. You stick out your hand and exclaim "I've got a treat for you. Please, please eat this and not me". Perplexed, the creature considers your offer. You approach slowly, placing the berries on the ground in front of you so that it may eat. Creature eats, and is delighted by the berries. In its ferverous hunger, it runs to the nearest berry vine and gobbles down more. Now is the time for you to make your escape. You continue down the right pathway.
