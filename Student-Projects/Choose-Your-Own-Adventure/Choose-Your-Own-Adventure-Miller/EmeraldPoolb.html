			After walking for what feels like an hour or so, you come across a clearing with a glowing, slowly-swirling, blue-green pool. it appears you have reached a dead end of the path from which you traveled; ahead of the pool, there is only more foliage, this time denser and seemingly more treacherous than before. You decide you can either continue through the woods or consult your book and explore the possible capabilities of this emerald pool.
