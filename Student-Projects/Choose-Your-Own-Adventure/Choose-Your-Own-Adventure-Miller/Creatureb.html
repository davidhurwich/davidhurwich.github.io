				You reach a clearing in the bush leading to two pathways, and suddenly a hungry creature appears. It snarls and prowls around you, you are paralyzed in fear. As if it couldn't get any worse, it begins to speak- in a low, rumbling, terrifying tone. "I am very hungry little traveler, I have been searching these woods high and low for something to eat, and you are the tastiest looking thing I have yet to find... unless of course you have something to feed me other than the skin off your back" You stammer out a response "but please, creature, I have nothing, only this book". "A book? Well little traveler, I have no desire for eating books". "Of course you don't!" You nervously begin to thumb through the book, checking to see if any of the surrounding flora is edible. You land on a page displaying the vines of bright green berry-like fruits you've been walking past for a while now. You thought they'd be unsafe, as they are green and look unripened, but they appear to be nourishing, according to the book. Nothing makes sense in this world, but it's your only hope. You approach a closeby vine and pluck the berries from their stems.
