        <p> A vast room with no ceiling comes into view as you enter the 20 foot doors. The sunlight shines down upon two pedestals before you. On one floats a red/orange orb, glowing bright. On the other floats a purple orb shining. These are the two magic sources Grindol has given you and now you must choose one. </p>



        <p> The powers that come will vary and will be unique to only you. </p>
