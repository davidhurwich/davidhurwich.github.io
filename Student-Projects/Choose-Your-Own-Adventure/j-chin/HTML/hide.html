<p> You chose to remain inside the castle at dawn while the army goes to battle. </p>



<p> In the distance, you see smoke, magic and flames scattering up into the air but you are too far to teleport or reach. </p>



<p> Before long, the castle gates are breached and the enemy kingdom find you, taking you prisoner. </p>



<p> The war has been lost. </p>
