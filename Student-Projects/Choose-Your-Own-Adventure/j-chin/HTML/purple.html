        <p> You approach the purple orb and it shines brighter while the orange orb dissolves. It latches onto your hand and up your arm like sparks of lightning. You feel a power surge through you, unlike any of your own and much more potent. Your eyes glow with the same purple hue until you feel energy building up, so much so that you cannot control it as the ground cracks beneath your feet all the way to the pedestal where the orb once was, destroying it. </p>



        <p> In surprise, you run out of the Temple and find Grindol who smiles at your choice, "You've chosen. Now you'll see what power you hold within you. Unleash it as your own, but be weary, for you can no longer bask in the sun. Now you are ready to become an Adviser," </p>



        <p> You follow Grindol to the Chamber of Sorcerers where you will be assigned to a Kingdom. </p>
