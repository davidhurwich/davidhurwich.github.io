        <p> You go through the left portal and suddenly, you're in free fall. The sky around you is bright blue with specks of white clouds here and there, but you are approaching the greenery of forest below at increasing speeds. </p>



        <p> You try to put your hands out to levitate but you're falling too fast. The ground closes in and you close your eyes, thinking these are your last moments but then, everything becomes still. When you open your eyes, you find yourself floating just inches above the grass and you look down to find a platform made of pure energy, glowing orange. </p>



        <p> You're confused of how your power had activated without your knowledge, but relieved nonetheless. Carefully, you step off the platform and begin walking. The road ahead is nothing but hills and forest, but in the distance, you see a large red castle. </p>



        <p> With prior training, you can teleport a few miles at a time until you reach the town closest to the castle. There, you meet the citizens of Eldaheim. </p>



        <p> They surround you, knowing exactly who you are by your attire, all their faces worried and pleading. </p>



        <p> "He's a madman, the king!" </p>



        <p> "Save us!" </p>



        <p> "He'll starve us without batting an eye!" </p>



        <p> Your concern for the people grows before you even arrive at the castle gates. But once you meet the king, you realize what the people were trying to tell you. He is a tyrant with a temper and you know immediately that it will be very difficult to be his adviser. </p>



        <p> The people plead and beg you. You even discover that there is a coup being planned where several hundred citizens are preparing to overthrow the king. They ask you to join, what will you do? </p>
