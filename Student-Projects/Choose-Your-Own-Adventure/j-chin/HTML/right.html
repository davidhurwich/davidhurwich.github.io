<p> You enter the right portal and appear inside a cold and dark stone room. The sun is setting and no one seems to be around but in the distance, you hear faint shouting. Upon listening closer, you find that the man is shouting orders to prepare their armory. </p>



        <p> Just then, the doors open and someone finds you, knowing exactly who you are by your attire. </p>



        <p> "You there, help us! We are at war!" </p>



        <p> You soon discover that you are advisor to the kingdom, Qaljord. The kingdom had recently been invaded by their neighboring kingdom and the king has joined his army in battle. The generals tell you to stay inside the castle as they fight because you have no experience in real combat. </p>



        <p> The next battle begins at dawn. Will you fight with the army and king? or do as you are told and remain hidden? </p>
