        <p> You have trained for years now under the Sorcerer, Grindol ever since you were taken in by him. You had no knowledge of your dormant powers but he saw it in you enough to make you into a true Sorcerer. He has become the father you never had. </p>



        <p> Now that your training has concluded, you shall ascend to become an Adviser, sent off to a distant world to council the monarchs of powerful kingdoms. </p>



        <p> Alongside you, your brethren in training will also ascend and you will part ways. Each new Sorcerer must find their power and the source of it which will be given to you by Grindol himself. </p>



        <p> As you and Grindol stand before the temple of wonders, he smiles at you and places a hand on your shoulder, "I'm proud of you. You have been a son to me and now you'll go off on your own," </p>



        <p>You enter the Temple of Wonders.</p>
