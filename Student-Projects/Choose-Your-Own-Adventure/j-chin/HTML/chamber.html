  <p> You enter the Chamber of Sorcerers to find 9 mentors standing in a circle. Grindol takes his place among them and gestures for you to stand in the center of their circle. </p>



<p> "Now you must choose where you ascend, where you become a true sorcerer," He and the others begin a spell, turning their palms out and motioning a circle. Two portals appear at each of your sides, they look the same and you cannot see through to the other side.</p>



<p> There is only one way to know where you're going, so which do you choose? </p>
