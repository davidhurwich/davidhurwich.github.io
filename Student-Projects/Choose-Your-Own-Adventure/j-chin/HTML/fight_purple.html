<p> You disobey the orders of the generals and find your way to the armory. That night, you stock up on a sword and dagger. </p>



<p> By dawn, you wear your hood and follow the army out to the front lines. </p>



<p> The invaders come with their own army and a battle breaks out, magic and metal collide in chaos as you try desperately to survive your first battle. </p>



<p> The odds are surprisingly even as the battle drones on for what seems like days but your energy has not left you. In fact, it seems to have increased as you fight. As you hack through enemies, you see in the distance a group of sorcerers conjuring but they fail to see an enemy running straight towards them. You teleport to them without hesitation and appear directly in front of the enemy who stops briefly before swinging his large ax down on you. </p>



<p> You counter with your sword but are brought down to your knee as you strain to hold him in hopes of buying time for the sorcerers. Just as you feel your sword begin to crack, tendrils of purple spread from your arms through your sword and to his ax. Your enemy is blasted nearly 20 feet back as your power activates. You can see him writhing in pain as the purple tendrils shock him and drain his energy. </p>



<p> The sorcerers finally finish their incantation and together, release a powerful bolt of light into the sky. As the light rains down, you can see enemies dropping where they stand. </p>



<p> The battle has been won. </p>


<p> The END </p>
