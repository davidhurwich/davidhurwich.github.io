        <p> You approach the orange orb and it glows brighter while the purple orb dissolves. It melds towards your hand and up your arm like veins. You feel a power surge through you, unlike any of your own and much more potent. Your eyes glow with the same orange hue until you feel energy building up, so much so that you cannot control it as a beam of light fires from your hand, destroying the pedestal where the orb once was. </p>



        <p> In surprise, you run out of the Temple and find Grindol who smiles at your choice, "You've chosen. Now you'll see what power you hold within you. Unleash it as your own but be weary for you can no longer bask in moonlight. Now you are ready to become an Adviser," </p>



        <p> You follow Grindol to the Chamber of Sorcerers where you will be assigned to a Kingdom. </p>
