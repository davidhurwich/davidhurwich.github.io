<p> You decide that the king is one that will never be convinced or changed for the better so you join the resistance. </p>



<p> On the set day, you and hundreds of citizens storm the capital and breach the castle gates, running through guards as you fight, finding more and more ways to use your newly acquired powers. </p>



<p> The citizens take the king from his throne and kill him. </p>



<p> Because you decided to help them despite being the kings adviser, they crown you their new king and hope you reign justfully. </p>

<p> The END </p>
