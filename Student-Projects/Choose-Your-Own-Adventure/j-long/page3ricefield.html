				You saw some fifty-year-old aunties and uncles working in the field: "It's so hot today, and moreover under the sun... It might be refreshing in there..." you thought while looking at the sun. You tested the water and it was suprisingly cold. You continued walking and saw some wild frogs jumping in and out from the field, dragonflies flying in every directions near the water and some lazy snails slowly moving on trees.
