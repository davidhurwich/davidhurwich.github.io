				When you arrived at the terminus, You saw that the city was forming a castle viewed from outside. There few farmers and some sheep that were grazing on grass. It seems like you already forgot about the Professor... But nothing, no sign or watsoever was giving you as hint to get closer to him...

				You saw a weird sheep with E-X-I-T marked on it. You went nearer and you saw a door in the tree next to the sheep.
