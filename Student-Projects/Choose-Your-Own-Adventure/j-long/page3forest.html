				When you entered the forest, you felt at peace. You could smell the scent of the grass mixed with that of some wild flowers. You saw a really old style japanese Torii and was somehow attracted by it. When you cross the gate, you suddenly felt a fresh breeze which make you shivered. You hugged yourself.

				There wasn't much people on the road. The few that you saw were some 60-ish old folks that were sweeping the cobbelstone road. When they saw you walk pass them, they gave you a little glimpse and went back to their tasks.
