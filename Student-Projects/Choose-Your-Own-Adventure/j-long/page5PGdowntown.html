				You ended up in this place. All the houses were similar and had that Swedish-chalet vibe. The main building were strange, it was like a tower with a big clock, vintage one. More intriguing, there wasn't number on the clock or you just couldn't read them. You heard a kid ask: "Mom, what time is it right know?"
