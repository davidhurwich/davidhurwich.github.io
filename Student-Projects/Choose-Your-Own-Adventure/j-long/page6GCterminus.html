				You hoped on the bus and when you got off, you were astonished by the view. The houses were forming a huge protective wall. No sign of Nazo-san... You were really wondering if this was a scam... But this place was really nice. You quickly forgot Nazo-san and decided to make the most out of this other world.

				Suddenly, the trees were forming like a path toward something(?). You felt some spiritual vibes but couldn't tell if they were good or not. "Ding, ding!" In the other hand, you heard the bus arriving.

				What would you choose to do?
