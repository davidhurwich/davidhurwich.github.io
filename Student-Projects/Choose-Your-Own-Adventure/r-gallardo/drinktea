                You wander through dark twists and turns for what feels like hours. When the sky starts to dim, you become worried that you will not be returning home anytime soon. You begin to hear rustling, and whispers. In a panic, you start running. You crash and hit your head. You wake up to a dozen small glowing fairies hovering above you with worried looks on their faces.
                “Who are you?” you ask.
                “We are moon fairies. We dwell within the darkest corners of the maze in order to live in solitude and peace. Usually, maze wanderers never come this way. You must be exhausted. Would you like some mushroom tea to settle your nerves and give you back your strength?”
