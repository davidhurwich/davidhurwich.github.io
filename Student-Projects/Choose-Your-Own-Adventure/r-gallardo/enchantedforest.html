                You've just moved into a new house with you parents in the middle of nowhere. There are no neighbors, no kids, no playgrounds, and town is a twenty-minute drive away. That's no fun for a ten-year-old boy. There is , however, a large maze about half a mile deep into the forest behind your house. Your dad says not to go near it, but what does he know? You're bored out of your mind, so you decide to explore the maze one morning. You pack a few snacks, put on your shoes, and tell your mother you're going to the creek to play and will be back by supper. After a little hike through the forest, you find it. Sitting like skyscrapers, the tall hedges that enclose the maze trap a ghostly fog whithin the maze. Yet, the fog seems to give off a warm glow, a glow that unexplainably draws you in. You get a sense that there is something extrodinary inside of this maze. Chills run down your spine. You are afraid, but before you know it you are walking towards the entrance.
