                You wander towards the light path and your nose is filled with a sweet floral fragrance. All along the path of the maze are bright colored flowers and rich green foliage. Further down the twists and turns of the maze, you come to a dead end. You are about to turn around, when you are struck with the scent of rotting flesh. The flowers around you shrivel up and die before your very eyes. You look up and see a large and horrific demon looking down upon you with his piercing yellow eyes.

                â€œI am Wormtounge. I eat wandering souls like you who are foolish enough to step foot into the maze. Unless, you have something of value to trade, such as that potion peeking out of your backpack. In return, I will spare you. What do you say, boy?
