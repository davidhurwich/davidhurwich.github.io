                You are footsteps away from entering the maze, when a small figure pops out of the brush and startles you. Frightened at the little dwarf, you start to run away. You’ve never seen a creature like this before.
                “Wait! Do not fear me! I am StoneClaw, a gentle keeper of this maze.”
                Curious about what he has to say, you slowly approach him and ask what goes on in the confines of the maze.
            </p>
                “Ah, listen here boy. The maze is much more than a puzzle, it is a journey, an adventure. However, you must be weary of the darkness that lurks in the most unsuspecting corners of the maze. Keep your guard up. Hm... you seem like a good boy with a good spirit. Take this…”
                Stoneclaw hands you a small, blue sparkly bottle. It’s warm.
                “This here is a stealth potion. For a brief moment, you are invisible. Use it wisely, for it can only be used once. Safe travels, and good luck young adventurer.“
                With the potion in your backpack, you begin to move forward.
