           After all that mess, you go back to walking down the alley. It's been a long day and you're still just trying to find a good snack, or at least some good company. You continue walking a bit until you stumble upon what appears to be loose peas. At this point, you'll honestly take anything so you start to eat them. Before you know it, you're walking down a line of peas. Maybe this is a bad idea but you're too engrossed in the peas to stop. Did someone leave these out for you?
