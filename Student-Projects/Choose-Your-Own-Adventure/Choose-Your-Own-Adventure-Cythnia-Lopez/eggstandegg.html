         You start to fully wake up and feel a blanket underneath you. It turns out that the egg man noticed how sick you had gotten, panicked, and had you quickly get checked out at the vet. After realizing that you just had a really bad tummy ache, he brought you home. Now you're here, on the coziest blanket in the world. The egg man comes into view and starts petting you. "Haha you silly little egg, I should have known better to feed you all those eggs. You know what, I think I'm gonna name you Egg. Because you love eggs so much!" Well, this has been an interesting turn of events. I guess your name is Egg now. Congratulations, you now live with the egg man, his egg wife, and all 7 of his crazy egg children in the egg house!
