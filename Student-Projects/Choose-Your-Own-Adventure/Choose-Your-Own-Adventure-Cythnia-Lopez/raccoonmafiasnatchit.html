           You go to snatch the cookie back from one of the raccoons but as you do, the cookie breaks in half and you're only able to run away with the crumbs of it in your mouth. You hear a squeak from the raccoon you took the cookie from before jumping out of the trash bin. You'd stay to catch the reactions of the rest of the raccoons, but decide that its probably better if you just keep on running down the alley and not get involved with their little raccoon mafia situation going on there.
