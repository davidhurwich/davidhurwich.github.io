           You're on maybe your 70th pea before you realize the two figures up ahead. You look up and see an old labrador dog and a girl crouching down, eagerly watching you. The girl goes to stand up but steps on some peas in the process, ruining her large tennis shoes. She really didn't think that through. You're caught off guard by the entire situation and go to hide behind some loose boxes against the walls of the alley.
