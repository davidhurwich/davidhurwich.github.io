           You hop in the van with them at the last second and in a few minutes, you end up at a bakery downtown. It's warm, cozy, and relaxed with soft music playing in the background. It looks like her and her family own this bakery, and they've been kind enough to let you in. You see the pie lady walk into the back room before coming out with a couple soft wash towels that she lays out in the corner for you. This becomes your bed for the next few nights, and eventually, she starts bringing you home with her when she closes the bakery, and brings you back when she opens. Some days, she sees you sleeping at her home and lets you stay, and you realize, you have found a home within her.
            <p>
                Congratulations! You have found a home!</p>
