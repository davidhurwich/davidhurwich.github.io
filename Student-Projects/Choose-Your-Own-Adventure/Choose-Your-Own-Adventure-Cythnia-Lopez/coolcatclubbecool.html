           You go ahead and act cool, whatever that means. You try to relax yourself and say that you're just here trying to get some food. All the others cats pause to look at each other, and with a subtle nodd, everyone goes back to looking through the trash. Before you even have time to think, you say, "Wait, what just happened," completely blowing your cool cover. A cat nearby doesn't even look up from their trash bag as they say, "Everyone here is just a stray cat trying to find some food. We understand." Oh. Nice, I guess. They notice your odd reaction and pause for a bit before asking if you'd be interested in joining their cool cat club.
