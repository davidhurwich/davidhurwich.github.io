           You wake up to the sound of a honking car. The busy city streets shock you as you open up your eyes- you don't recognize this part of the city. Maybe sleeping in the back of a truck wasn't the smartest course of action last night, but in your defense, the blankets were cozy. You're feeling quite hungry and spot a farmer's market a couple blocks away. You hop out of the back of the parked truck and start heading over, hoping to find some grub.
