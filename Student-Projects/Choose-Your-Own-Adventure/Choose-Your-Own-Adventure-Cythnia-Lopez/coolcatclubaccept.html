           Your new cat buddy, Stick (yes that is their actual name), takes you over to the two coolest cats out of the whole group, and tells them that you're interested in joining. They look extremely intimidating and you feel an uneasiness in your stomach as they look over you. Wow, you're not really sure what you got yourself into. It is not too late to leave. But there is a chance that you'll be able to join their group. What do you do?
