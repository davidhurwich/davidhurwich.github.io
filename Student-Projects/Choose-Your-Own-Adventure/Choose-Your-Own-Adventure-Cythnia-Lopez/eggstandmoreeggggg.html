           EGG. It is the only thing on your mind. The world around you starts to fade away as you lose track of all the egg offerings the egg man has made. You open your eyes- are you laying down? From what you can make out, he is above you offering more egg. One last one can't hurt. Or can it? You're unsure. You're not sure how you ended up lying on your back anyways. You just really want the egg. Here is his last offering. You're on the road to sickness but it's okay. It's gonna be okay. Maybe you can crawl away to freedom from the egg sickness but you just might risk it all for that egg. Yes, you might RISK IT ALL FOR THAT EGG. What do you choose?
