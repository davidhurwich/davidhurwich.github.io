           You decide to meow louder in the hopes of getting more food, but the loud meow startles not only her but her kid giving out samples that hadn't noticed you before! They get excited and drop the platter of samples, loudly crashing on the ground next you. Your first instinct is to run and before you realize it, you are in the middle of the busy farmers market crowd. You continue running off, trying to find a quiet, isolated space.
