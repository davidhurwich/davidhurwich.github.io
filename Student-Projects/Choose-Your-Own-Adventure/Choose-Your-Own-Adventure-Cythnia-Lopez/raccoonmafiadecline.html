           You respectfully decline their offer. The raccoon mafia is a bit too intimidating for your liking and you decide that it is better for you to go elsewhere than hang around them for too long. Plus, you think that if you are around their trash for a second longer you might actually throw up. You look down the alleyway and politely decline their offer before running off.
