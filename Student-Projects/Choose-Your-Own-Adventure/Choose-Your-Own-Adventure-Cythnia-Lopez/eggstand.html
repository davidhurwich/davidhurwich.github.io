          You end up running under the egg stand for cover. It seems like the loud man in charge of the stand is too busy talking about eggs to notice you. You hear him telling a customer that he actually can't eat eggs because he's allergic to vitamin D. You appreciate his passion for eggs nonetheless. Should you try to steal an egg while he's distracted or meow in the hopes that he'll be kind enough to offer you some?
