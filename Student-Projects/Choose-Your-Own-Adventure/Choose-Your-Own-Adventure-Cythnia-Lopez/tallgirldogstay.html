           The meow was more than enough of a confirmation for her. She walks over to you and tests to see if you let her pick you up, which you do. It feels a lot warmer up here in her arms, and you're quick to cozy up to her. You feel like you can trust her, and the dog with nice eyes who doesn't say much. She carries you back to her apartment, feeding you peas the entire time. Yeah, you think you can get used to this. Congratulations! You found a home with a tall girl and her kind dog!
