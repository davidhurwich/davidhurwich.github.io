           The eggs taste amazing. You're getting more and more addicted. But with every bite, your stomach gets fuller and fuller. But that's what you want, isn't it? You want to be fuller, but you don't want to get sick. You could leave to stop yourself from getting sick, but where's the fun in that? So, are you going to ask for more egg?
