           You look up and see the most beautifully enticing pies you have ever seen in your life. You have a solid planâ€” pounce, grab, and run. There's no way that it can go wrong, except, for her kid giving out samples who sees you and starts yelling excitedly. The small pie you're holding onto breaks in half as you try to grab it and you quickly run away with half of a small pie. Not the largest meal, but surely the most delicious. You have two options, you can either run out of the farmers market completely to somewhere more secluded, or hide under the egg stand you saw earlier.
