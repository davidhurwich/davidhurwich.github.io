           While hiding under the stand surrounded by broken eggs, you see the man get on the ground before lifting up the cloth hanging in front of you. You see that he's pale with an orange head of hair and a beard to match. He sees that you're scared and leaves for a moment. This time when he lifts the cloth, you see his hand extending out the most beautifully prepared piece of egg avocado toast. You're still on edge from the broken eggs and can barely think. Do you take his peace offering, or run away to somewhere more secluded where you can gather your thoughts?
