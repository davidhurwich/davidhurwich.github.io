           You decide to stay and begin to exchange your experiences as stray cats living in the city, and find out that everyone is actually really cool. The two cats in charge teamed up with each other and have slowly been taking more and more lonely strays under their wing, creating a new found family. That night, the group decides to take you to one of their favorite spots in the city that overlooks the water with the perfect view of the bridge. You've never experienced the city like this before and have become so thankful for you new found family. Congratulations! You found a home within the cool cat club!
