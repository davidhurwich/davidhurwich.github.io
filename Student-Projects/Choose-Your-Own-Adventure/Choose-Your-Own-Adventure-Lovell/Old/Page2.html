				You are suddenly awoken to the bright flash of an orange light. You’re in the captain’s quarters, you’re the only one who doesn’t sleep with the rest of the crew. The light is coming from an information panel. You bolt out of bed and run over to the panel. You scan the complicated interface and see that there’s an issue with power delivery. If the issue persists for another two minutes, the whole crew will be alerted to the problem. That might cause unnecessary panic so you decide to fix the problem yourself. What could it be?
