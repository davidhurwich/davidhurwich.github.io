				The year is 2064. You are the captain of a spaceship heading towards Mars. It’s the first of the new class of spaceships launched. Everything is new and there’s actually enough space to be comfortable on your 19 month journey to Mars. The biggest improvement is the gravity. Not only does it feel almost like earth, but the human body isn’t subjected to the normal effects of being in space for this long. You have been in space for a little over 9 weeks now, or at least that’s what the calendar says, but to you it feels like forever. There are 10 other crew members with you on your journey. A mix of engineers, scientists and a couple civilians.
