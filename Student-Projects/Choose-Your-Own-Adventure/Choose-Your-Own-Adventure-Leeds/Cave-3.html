    <p>You notice from the entrance that this is a deep cave. You grab a flashlight, your emergency supplies, and backpack, and turn off the truckâ€™s high beams. You walk down the cave for a few minutes. </p>
<p><em> This seems like a good hiding place. </em> </p>

<p>You notice this strange glowing light coming from the end of the tunnel. As you get closer, you see that it is a ring of blue neon light and behind it, the cave's wall. As you step up to the ring to get a closer look, the wall behind it starts moving, like when heat reflects off a hot surface. You put your hand through the ring. There is a drastic temperature difference on the other side. You almost forget to breathe as your hand disappears from sight.  </p>
