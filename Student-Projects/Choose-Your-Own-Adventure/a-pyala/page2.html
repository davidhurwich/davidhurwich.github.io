                        <p> You are getting a phone call in the middle of the night. You pick up and hear the voice of your old friend Ardin but something seems off.. You hear a muffled voice trying to scream to get your attention in the background.
                        </p>
                        <p> <i>
                                Ardin: Hello old friend. Been a long time since you've heard my voice... I'll cut to the point. I still haven't forgotten about the time you let me get caught for the crime I was helping you commit. Now as payback, I have something of yours and the only way you can get it back is giving me something I want...
