                            The guards were a good distance away from you and you felt like you can manage getting away through the front. Unfortunately one of the civilians nearby tripped you and the guards end up catching you. Luckily PetreÄ“ manages to get away but you can't help but wish maybe it would have been a better idea for him to have stolen the painting and you have been the distraction.
