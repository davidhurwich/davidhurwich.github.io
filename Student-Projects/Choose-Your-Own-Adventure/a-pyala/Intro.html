                        <p> You are a master thief in the year 3072. You have grown up with fellow thieves in a guild after you have been taken in by the leader. Although these members are the only family you know, you still cannot trust some of them because as a thief, there are no rules.
                        </p>

                            With everything being mostly digital, the physical versions of books and paintings are valued highly due to them being the last remaining physical copies.
