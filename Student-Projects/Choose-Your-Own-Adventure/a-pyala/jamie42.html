                            As you were distracting Ardin with your tale of how you managed to steal the painting. Jamie's bot knocks him over and you PetreÄ“ manages to tie him up. You get the keys from him and manage to save your daughter Jezze. You guys also call the local enforcement and spin the tale and frame the theft on Ardin. He now gets locked up for a while. There is no honor among thieves.</p>
