        <p>You find two of the prettiest flowers, one for your friend and one for your den. Then you set out to the grove where you find them unpacking their picnic basket. They offer you to have a bite with them and the two of you eat and talk about the flowers you just saw. Your friend is so happy that you brought them one. After lunch you leave your friend to see what is happening at the stream.</p>
