        <p>There are so many beautiful flowers to sniff and birds and ladybugs to see! You wander the field and go to every kind of flower growing there. Soon the sun becomes warm and makes you sleepy. But you would really like to take one of these flowers to your friend who will be having a picnic lunch in the grove. Do you nap or go to the grove?</p>
