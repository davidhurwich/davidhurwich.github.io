        <p>There is nice patch of grass that looks like a swell spot for a nap. You decide on just taking a short cat nap before continuing your adventure for the day. But you wake shortly from a twitchy feeling on your nose. It is a colorful butterfly! The butterfly tells you it has a riddle for you to answer, and if you are correct you will get to see a wonderous site. Excited for more things to see and do today, you jump to your feet and ask for the riddle.</p>
