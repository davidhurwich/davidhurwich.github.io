        <p>You go to where you know of a waterfall and look around. Then you notice something you had never noticed before, a warm glow coming from behind the fall. You trek behind the curtain of water to a cave... full of fireflies' dancing lights!</p>

        <p>You take in the light show for a few more moments before heading out. What a great day! Time to go home.</p>
