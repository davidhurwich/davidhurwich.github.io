            <h2>Who are you?</h2>
            <p>As you continue to walk around, you can’t help but feel that someone is stalking you. You can’t stand it and turn around suddenly. Your eyes are fixed onto the hooded person with a scythe. You screeched, "AHHHHH! W-WH-WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?! W-WHY ARE YOU ALL BONES??" </p>

            <p>You stood there all frozen with thousands of thoughts running across your mind.</p>

            <p>The hooded human skeleton stood there and quietly said, “Hi kiddo...I am the Grim Reaper. I'm supposed to take you to Hades for judgement.”</p>

            <p>“Eek! S-stop following me!! I didn’t do anything bad to deserve this!”</p>

            <p>“Hey kid. Please don’t make my job harder. I’m just here to guide you to Hades, so just come with me and we'll go along our merry own way. Hades only punishes those who did wrong. If you didn’t do anything, you’ll be fine.” You nodded hesitantly.</p>
            <p>The Grim Reaper picks you up and asks, “Do you want to travel across lakes, dry lands, or mountains? Your pick.” You could only respond warily... </p>
