            <h2>Run to the Gates of Hell</h2>
            <p>You got to the gate and it opened up surprisingly. Not too far behind, the Grim Reaper is running while attacking and dodging the hellhounds attacks. Once the Grim Reaper made it into the gates, the hellhounds ran away.</p>

            <p>You wheezed and said, “I d-definitely don’t want to ex-experience that ever again. B-by the way, what’s with this gate? The hellhounds were running away once we got in.”</p>

            <p>The Grim Reaper chuckled, “They’re probably scared of what’s inside.”</p>

            <p>You began to get nervous and thought what could possibly be scarier than a pack of hellhounds after you. You quivered, “I-inside?”</p>

            <p>Seeing your reaction, the Grim Reaper laughed. “Welcome to Hades’s Castle kiddo.”</p>
