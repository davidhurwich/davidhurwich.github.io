            <h2>Siren's Melody</h2>
            <p>You insist on taking a closer look despite the Grim Reaper’s warning. Once you are within range, the siren has you hooked onto her melody. You jump out of the boat and drown in the lake without struggle.</p>

            <p>The Grim Reaper sighs…“There goes another poor soul that can’t reincarnate anymore. If only the kid listened…. I guess this is another day on the job.” </p>
