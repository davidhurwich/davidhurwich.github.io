            <h2>Not Today</h2>
            <p>You and the Grim Reaper ran as fast as possible on the rocky path, but it was hard to see when the light was getting dim. You heard faint singing, but it wasn’t enough to mesmerize you. You were thankful you were no longer near the siren. However, you stumbled onto a rock and fell.</p>

            <p>You thought you were going to have a rough tumble with rocks, but was met with soaked clothes. The Grim Reaper grabbed your hand to pick you back up, until you felt a cold slimy hand on your ankle.            </p>

            <p>You shivered in fear, and turned around to see the siren ready to attack. In a split second, you grabbed the Grim Reaper’s scythe to slice off the hand and made a run for it. You internally thought to yourself, “Not today siren.” As you ran, you heard a fierce screech in the distance, but that didn’t matter. Your first priority was to get out of the cave fast.</p>
            
            <p>You slowed down as you saw a decorated door, and asked “Why is there a fancy door here Grim Reaper?”</p>
            
            <p>“Oh great &nbsp;job kiddo. You found the entrance to Hades’s Castle.”</p>
