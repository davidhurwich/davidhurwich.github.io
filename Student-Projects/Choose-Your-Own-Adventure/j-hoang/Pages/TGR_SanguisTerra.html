            <h2>Sanguis Terra</h2>
            <p>You decided to travel across dry lands. All there is are dead plants, and a few rocks here and there. From afar, you can see the mountains and lake. Otherwise, it’s practically a barren cracked land here. You muttered, “I thought this place would be crawling with all sorts of demons and creatures. It’s so dead here...”</p>

            <p>“Well you aren’t exactly wrong”, the Grim Reaper replied. “This place is known as Sanguis Terra. If we were in the mainland…..then yeah, you would see a jackpot of demons and creatures.”</p>
            
            <p>You questioned, “What’s Sanguis Terra?”</p>
            
            <p>The Grim Reaper smiled and teasingly replied, “It’s better for you to not know. You would freak out like the kiddo you are.”</p>
            
            <p>You give the Grim Reaper a deadpan look. “Hmph! Fine then.”</p>
            
            <p>“Alright kid I’m teasing you. Sanguis Terra is latin for “Land of Blood”. Ju-”</p>

            <p>You stuttered, “L-land of blood?? I-is that why the ground here is so red?”</p>
            
            <p>“Hey kid, listen to me. As long as you don’t bleed a single drop, you’ll be fine.”</p>
            
            <p>“And if I do? What happens?”, you quietly asked.</p>
            
            <p>“Well then…. The hellhounds will be right at your back. Nothing is better than juicy humans like you.”</p>
            
            <p>You could only shrink at the thought of hellhounds eating you.</p>
