            <h2>Hades's Judgment</h2>
            <p>You safely made it to Hades’s castle. It was kind of a pain to go through such a long journey to get Hades’s judgment. After everything that happened, you were just glad you made it in one piece.</p>

            <p>You stepped onto a platform nervously, and answered all the questions that Hades’s threw at you honestly. You felt so lonely without the Grim Reaper as you stood alone in the hall.</p>

            <p>Hades looked at you up and down. There was a long silence, and you were beginning to feel nervous. Even after all that happened, you felt this was the most stressful of all. Your fate rests in the hands of Hades’s judgment, and you wouldn’t be able to do anything about it.</p>

            <p>Hades suddenly got up and left the hall.</p>

            <p>You were puzzled and unsure what to do. Do I stay? Do I leave? But you decided it’s better to wait for him to come back.</p>

            <p>A few minutes later, Hades came back into the hall along with the Grim Reaper.</p>

            <p>In a dignified voice, Hades asked, “Do you want to be reborn? Of course, without memories. Or do you want to be a Grim Reaper?”</p>

            <p>You were about to say okay, but then you did a double take. </p>

            <p>“Um what?”</p>
