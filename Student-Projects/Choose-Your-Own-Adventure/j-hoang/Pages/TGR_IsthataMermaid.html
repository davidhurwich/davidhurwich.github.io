            <h2>Is that a Mermaid?</h2>
            <p>You decided to travel across Singing Paradise lakes using a boat. </p>

            <p>It dawned upon you that this hell is mixed with all sorts of mythical creatures that you wouldn’t have guessed to be here. You muttered to yourself, “It sure is different here. I thought it would only be scary demons and hellish creatures of sorts. The lake here is beautiful.” In fact, you spotted a mermaid and rowed the boat closer towards the mermaid.</p>

            <p>The Grim Reaper notices your sudden behavior and commented, “You know kid… Don't be fooled. There’s a difference between mermaids and sirens. Mermaids only have fish tails while sirens have more scales all over their bodies and face.”</p>
