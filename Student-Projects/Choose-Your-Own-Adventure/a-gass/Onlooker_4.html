                I am waiting. <br><br>

                It has probably been an hour since I have been waiting. It seems like one week. <br><br>

                I am used to waiting for things to happen. Apparently though, this option is not helping me to understand what is going on. <br><br>

                Should I do something? <br><br>

                I don’t think walking around the darkroom without any destination would provide me any insight. <br>

                Therefore, I should probably start counting the seconds until something happens. I have nothing to do. <br><br><br>
