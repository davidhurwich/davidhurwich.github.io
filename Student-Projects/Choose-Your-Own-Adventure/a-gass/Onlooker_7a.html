                I kick the door. But it is too dense to budge. I try to force with all my energy. <br><br>
                An alarm turns on. I look around and all the people around me are laughing and applauding. I hear the grating of metal. I am scared.<br><br>
                A steel box lowers over the walls. I didnâ€™t even have time to escape from it since it captured me immediately. I am stuck. <br><br><br>

                Was it the right thing to do? <br>
                Why did I decide to pick the easiest path without struggling?<br><br><br>

                Darkness envelopes me. There is now nothing for me to do or see anymore, and after some time passes, nothing left for me to feel either. In some way, I got what I wished for. I spent my life waiting, waiting, eschewing any choices to be made. <br>
                I have an entire eternity to myself.

                <br><br>
