                I hear a metal door shutting behind me. The light turns on. I’m in a different room. No glass walls. Just me. There is a chair in front of me. I take a seat. What now? Probably just having good intentions was not enough. I hear the familiar sound of a projector.<br><br>
                It shows me in loop the images of my life.<br><br>

                Probably they know I would go back to how it was before.<br>
                <strong>You cannot change human nature.</strong><br><br>
                I guess I’m stuck here, at least I’m alone with my thoughts.<br><br><br>
                This must be my victory: I got out of the glass box.
