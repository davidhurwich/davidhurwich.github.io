                The keypad flashes green. Sadly, it was the right answer. Everything shuts off. I can’t see anything anymore.<br><br>
                I hear a whirring of machinery starting up above me. I look up and I am blinded for a second. My eyes adjust and I see a projection on the floor.<br><br>
                There are photograms of happy moments that I spent with my daughter.
                I can hear her voice. I can actually see her out of this glass prison. She is here crying and shouting.<br><br>
                This means that by exiting this door I can finally be with her. I can finally give her the attention I needed to give to her.<br><br>

                I hear a click. A shaft of light illuminates the door. It’s unlocked.<br><br>
                What do I do now?
