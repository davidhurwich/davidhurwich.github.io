       You've decided to take the open road. 
<p>

You walk for a couple miles and along the way you rummage through some abandoned cars. You find some water and some food, but no bullets or medicine. Walking a little further, you come across a convenient store, it is packed with food, water, and medicine but it is also packed with 8-10 zombies.
</p>
<p>
You think about what you've found already, is it good enough? You do really need the medicine just in case, and more food and water wouldn't hurt. There are a lot of zombies for one person to take, should you risk it?
