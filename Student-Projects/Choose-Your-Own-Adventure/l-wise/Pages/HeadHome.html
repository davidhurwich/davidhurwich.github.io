        You start to head home through the forest with all that you have gotten.
        </p>

        On your way home you hear someone yell "Help!", you start to go where the yelling is coming from. At a slight distance you see a man, alone, on the ground. You ask him what has happened. He explains how he has been shot by another man who turned on him. You walk a little closer cautiously. You don't see any blood, but he seems to be in a lot of pain.
