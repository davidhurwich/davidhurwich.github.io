      You've decided to walk deeper into the forest. 

<p>
Your main concern is food and water, you start heading towards a river you have seen a couple times. 
</p>
<p>
30 minutes has passed, and you've made it to the river. You start to collect the water when you suddenly hear rustling in the trees behind you. You quickly turn around to see what it is, praying its a deer rather than the dead. You see a zombie coming you way. What do you do?
