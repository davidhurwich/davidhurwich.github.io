  You begin to hunt. You come across a deer and track it for a couple miles. Once the coast is clear and no zombie appears to be around, you aim your gun and shoot. You successfully shot the deer and now have food. 

        </p>
        <p>
You sling the deer over your shoulders, and start to head home.
        </p>
        <p>

A few minutes into your walk home, two people stop you in your path. You drop the deer and pull out your knife, you don't know if they can be trusted. With hands raised, they introduce themselves as Sally and David. David, a 40 or so looking man with a kind voice begins to explain that they are from a community. They have food, shelter, water, weapons and people. Sally explains that they watched you hunt and were impressed and could use your skills in the community.

They offer you a spot.
