    You stabbed the zombie swiftly right in the head, killing it. You see 5 more zombies in the distance and duck for cover behind a fallen log and wait for them to pass. Good thing you didn't shoot the zombie and attract the others, there's no way you could take all them on with such a low supply of ammo. 

<p>
    You finish collecting water, and start tracking a deer to hunt.
