        You walk outside your shelter, with gun strapped to your waist and knife drawn, - since you know loud noise, like a gun firing, can draw more zombies- you look around for any wandering zombies. Its clear. You are trying to decide which way to go, deeper into the forest where you can hunt for food, or the open road and scavenge.
