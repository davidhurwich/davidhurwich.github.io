            <p> When they find the Keeper, she's standing in front of her house. Small snails make lazy swirling patterns on the walls with their slime. The Keeper slowly turns to the two of them. </p>

            <p> "H-hello Keeper!" Terry pipes up, "I'm Terry, and this is my friend, Orion. She's helping me find my way back to the swamps, do you know where that is?"</p>

            <p> "I can help you find your way, but I can't go with you. Take this conch with you and my helpers will guide you to the right path." She puts the shell in Orion's hands, and points deeper into the forest. "Your home is past the Grassy Plains. Good luck, and steer clear of Coriander." She doesn't elaborate and goes back to her snails.</p>
