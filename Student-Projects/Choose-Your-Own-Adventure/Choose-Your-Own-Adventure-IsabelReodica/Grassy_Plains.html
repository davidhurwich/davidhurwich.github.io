            <p>Terry and Orion enter the grassy plains. It's oddly quiet, as if all the insects have disappeared... A vine suddenly wraps around Orion's torso, and both her and Terry are lifted off the ground.</p>

            <p>"I am Coriander! The plains are <em>my</em> territory! Anyone who trespasses gets EATEN! HA HA!" A girl emerges from between the trees. She has the features of a venus fly trap, and most likely the deadly teeth of one as well.</p>
