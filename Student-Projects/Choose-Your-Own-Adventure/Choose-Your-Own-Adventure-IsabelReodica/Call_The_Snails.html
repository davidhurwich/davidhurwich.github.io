            <p>Terry takes the conch in his stubby legs and blows into it. As soon as he does, snails begin to pop out of the woodworks and make their way towards them.</p>

            <p>"Hello travelers, did you need help around these parts?"</p>

            <p>Terry answers first. "I need help finding my way home. I live in the swamps, do you know where that is?"</p>

            <p>"We only know a little bit of this area, but if you go down the River path, you'll be on the right track!"</p>

            <p>"Thank you!"</p>

            <p>"May your travels be safe and slimy!" They wave the two of them off with their eye stalks and disappear into the wood again.</p>
