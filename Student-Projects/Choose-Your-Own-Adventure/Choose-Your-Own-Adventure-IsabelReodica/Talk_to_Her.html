            <p> The woman slowly turns towards her, and it feels like the world has never been slower.</p>

            <p> She looks Orion up and down. "...You look lost," she says, and smiles gently as if she hadn't just read her mind. "Ohoho, don't worry, I'm just used to dealing with lost travelers. I am the Keeper of the Snails. I can lead you back to where you began, it's not far."</p>

            <p>Relief washes over Orion. "That's great! Lead the way, miss!"</p>
