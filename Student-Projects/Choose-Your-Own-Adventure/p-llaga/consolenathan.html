    <h1>You Console Nathan</h1>

    <p>You want to laugh because this is a bad date cliché. You try to pull yourself together and try to express a little bit of sympathy.<br>
		“I’m sorry that happened to you Nathan. It wasn’t your fault and I think you deserve better. It’ll take time to move on from this traumatic experience, but you’ll be okay.”<br>


“Thank you for that. I’m sorry for getting so emotional,” Nathan says as he slowly stops crying.<br>


Despite all of that, the date seems to be going okay.<br>
