    <h1>You Meet Up With Nathan</h1>
    <img src= "nathan4.png">
    <p>You and Nathan finally meet. “You’re Nathan, right?” “Yes. Nice to meet you.” You’re relieved he’s not a catfish. Could’ve been worse. The date starts and it is a little awkward. He seems okay so far, no turn-offs just yet. You’re not getting any serial killer vibes so far, but then again that’s how it starts out every time, right?<br>
	You find out he’s just gotten out of a relationship, his dog’s name is Robert, he’s Canadian and he graduated from one of Canada's top business schools with really good grades.
