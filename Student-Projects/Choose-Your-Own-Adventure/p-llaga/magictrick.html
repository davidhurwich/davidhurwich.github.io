    <p>You both order drinks and the conversations are getting a bit more interesting.<br> 
		
	Nathan starts talking about his recent ex-girlfriend and reveals that she cheated on him. Tragic.<br> 
		
 	Looks like this guy hasn’t moved on.<br>
		
	He starts to cry.<br>
	
	"Sorry about that," says Nathan. "I can show you a magic trick."
