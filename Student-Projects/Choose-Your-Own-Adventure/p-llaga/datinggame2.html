    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
    <img src= "tv1.png">
    <p>It’s Friday night again and you’re alone in your room with your dog re-watching The Office, again. You’re getting bored of your usual routine which is scrolling through and refreshing every social media app for new content every five minutes. You’re wondering what else you can do since you’re too lazy to do anything.<br>
		
	Out of severe boredom and curiosity, you download Tinder. You’re setting up your profile and preferences.<br>


You start swiping through the potential candidates. “Ugh, I went to high school with this dude, he didn’t age well.” “Gross,” or “Your cat is cuter than you” are some of the things you’re saying as you mostly swipe left through these bachelors.<br>


You come across this guy Nathan, 24, and lives 15 miles away. He is okay-looking. He has a cute dog in one of his pictures. That’s really his main attraction. “Seems like a pretty decent choice for now,” you think to yourself. As you know, swiping left means no and swiping right means yes. <br>
