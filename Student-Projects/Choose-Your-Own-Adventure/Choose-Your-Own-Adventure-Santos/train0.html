            <h1> Train Problem </h1>
        </header>

        <p class="p1"> After a good night’s sleep, you walk to the training headquarters across the town. They begin teaching you how to conduct the train.<br><br>
            “This isn’t too bad. This is easy!”<br><br>
            As you are conducting, you see that ahead on the tracks are three Wymph civilians whose long dresses have gotten caught in the railway tracks—unable to move. Your train is headed straight toward them. You try stopping the train, but the lever to stop won’t budge! However, the lever to switch the track works. But on the other track stands the Wymph queen, whose dress happens to be caught on the track as well!<br><br>
            If you do nothing, the three Wymphs on the main track will die.<br><br>
            If you pull the lever, diverting the train onto the side track, the queen will die.
            <br><br>
