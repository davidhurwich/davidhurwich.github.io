    <p class="p1"> “A human?!” they exclaim.<br><br>
    <i>Oh no.</i> “Yes, I am, unfortunately,” you say.<br><br>
	“Ah. Very well,” they leader says. “You have passed our test.”<br><br>
	“What?” you ask.<br><br>
	They all take their shades off. “We are not actually blind. When we saw your human spacecraft land on our planet, we definitely had our suspicions. But we wanted to give you a chance to prove yourself…<br><br>
	“And you have! Thank you for your honesty. Not all humans are horrible like we have heard.”<br><br>
    <i>Phew!</i> They lead you to their palace, and you wind up in a hallway.<br><br>
	“Your room is at the very end of the hall. We will have food for you in the morning. Sleep well!” They leave.<br><br>
	You walk to the end of the hall. You notice that there is a door next to your room. It is labeled with a sign that says DO NOT ENTER.
