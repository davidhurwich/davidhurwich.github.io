        <p class="p1"> “Hello. What is your name, and what brings you to Chidi?”<br><br>
            “My name is Terra. I’m the last of humankind from Earth. May I ask what kind of creatures you are?”<br><br>
            “We are the Wymphs: forest spirits.”<br><br>
            “Cool!” you say. “I am seeking a place to stay and some work, as my planet has been destroyed.”<br><br>
            “I see. We are sorry to hear about your planet.” They bow. “As for your request, we have very tight systems in place here. Everybody has a specific role in our society. However, there is one job opening we may be able to give you.”<br><br>
            “What is it?”<br><br>
            “Our main train conductor has been having trouble on the job recently. She does not know that we are considering dropping her. We could train you for that position, if you are willing.”<br><br>
            This is an opportunity to work. But you do feel bad for taking that person’s job.
