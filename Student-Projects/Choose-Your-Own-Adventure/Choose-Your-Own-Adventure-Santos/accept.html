        <p class="p1"> “Great! We will begin training you tomorrow.”<br><br>
            The Wymphs lead you to their palace and into a room. “This is where you will be sleeping. Training begins soon, so rest well.” They leave.<br><br>
            As you close the door, you are startled to find someone a dog-bear creature behind the door! It looks just as frightened.<br><br>
            “Who are you??” you ask. Is this a Pawian? What are they doing in Chidi?<br><br>
            Suddenly, it morphs into a Wymph!<br><br>
            “Please don’t tell anyone,” they beg. "I’m originally from the planet Whopp. I was sent on a mission to observe the people on this planet, and I had to blend in with my shapeshifting abilities. But my cover might be blown soon...there’s a glitch, and I keep switching back to my Pawian form at random times. It’s affecting my job. Having paws makes it really hard to conduct the train.”<br><br>
            “You’re the train conductor!?”<br><br>
            “Yes. Please don’t tell anyone!”
