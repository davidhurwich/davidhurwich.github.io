            <h1>"A Sponge" </h1>

            <p>
              
Sophie and Sansome decided "a sponge" was the right answer.
            </p>
            <p class="dialouge">
            Why yes, yes, it is”
            </p>
            <p>
The coin swung backwards and cleared a way for the children to pass.
                Sophie and Sansome crossed the bridge without looking back.</p>
            <p class="dialouge">
“That was weird,” noted Sansome.  
            </p>
            <p>
Soon they came upon another strange site. It looked as if three giant pens stood rooted in the velvet earth. As they approached the twins noticed they had faces. All three were asleep.
            </p>
            <p class="dialouge">
“Should we wake them?" Sophie whispered to her brother.
            </p>
            <p>
But before they could make a decision the pens began to wake on their own.
They gave a big yawn and turned to face the children. 
            </p>
            <p class="dialouge">
“We have woken because we have sensed you were in need” said the pen in the middle.
“If you answer our riddle, we will take you to where the money gathers.”
            </p>
            <p>
Sophie and Sansome took a step back and whispered to each other.
            </p>
            <p class="dialouge">
“Should we trust them?”
            </p>
