                Sophie and Sansome both raced to the couch, eager to find the remote before the other.
                
                <br>
                
                Sophie and Sansome both plunged their arms into the old purple sofa and felt around as muchas they could for the missing remote.

            <p class="dialouge"> 
                "I don't feel anything," <br> 
                grunted Sophie.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They both pushed their arms deeper into the cushions.
            </p>
            
            <p class="dialouge"> 
                "Woah, woah wooooooah!"
                <br>
                yelped Sansome.
            </p>


            <p>
                Sophie and Sansome plunged into the center of the couch. They tumbled quickly but gentle down a deep, dark tunnel and finally landed in a mysterious world. 
                <br>
            </p>
            
            <p class="dialouge"> 
                "Where are we?"
            </p>
            
            <p>
                They looked at one another and then at the sign before them...
            </p>
