                The children came upon what looked like a river. Coins were rolling by quickly.
                <br>
                
                Sometimes they would separate and roll off into some other part of the jungle. There were so many of them rolling together at once, it looked like waves. There was a bridge that connected two hills from which the coins passed between. At both ends of the bridge was a very large coin, perhaps the gatekeeper.
                <br>
                
                Sophie and Sansome cautiously made their way to the bridge and looked up at the looming currency.

                “Excuse me?” asked Sophie sheepishly.
                “Hmpfh!” The coin flipped and looked at the children, “Can I help you?”
                “We’d like to cross the bridge” asked Sansome.
                “You may cross if you answer my riddle or we can make a trade instead” answered the coin.
