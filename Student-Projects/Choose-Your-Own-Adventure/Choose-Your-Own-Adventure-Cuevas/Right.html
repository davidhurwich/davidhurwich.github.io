 <p>
 Sophie and Sansome decided to go right. 
Sophie touched the velvet ground, it felt just like their couch. 
     <br>
She’d always secretly hated that couch… and now look at the mess they were in! 
The whole place was made of different shades of Velvet.

            <p class="dialouge">
“Are we inside the couch??” wondered Sansome.
            </p>
            <p>
Sophie and Sansome walked deeper into the plush jungle. 
                </p>
            <p class="dialouge">
“I just want to find the remote and go home” whimpered Sansome.
“Do you hear that?” asked Sophie.
The twins could hear soft muffled chatter in the distance.
