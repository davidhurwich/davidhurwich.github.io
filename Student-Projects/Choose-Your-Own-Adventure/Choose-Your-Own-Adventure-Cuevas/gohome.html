            <p>

                The remote was barley visible on the mound of junk it was sitting on. Sophie and Sansome ran towards the mountain and began to climb it. </p>
            <p class="dialouge">
                “Be careful!” Sophie warned from above her brother.
            </p>
            <p>
                The mountain of junk was difficult to climb. Things slipped out from under them and made it more difficult to keep going.
                Finally, the two reached the side of the mountain where their remote was.
                Sansome pushed Sophie a bit higher up and she pulled the remote free. As she did, the two lost grip and began sliding down the mountain.
            </p>
            <p class="dialouge">

                “Ahhhhhhhh!”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sophie clutched the remote tightly so not to lose it again and in doing so pressed the “return” button.
                <br>

            <p class="dialouge">
                *POOF*
            </p>

            <p>
                Sophie and Sansome were back in their living room as if nothing happened.
            </p>
            <p class="dialouge">
                “Ummmmm”
            </p>
            <p>
                The two twins stepped away from the couch and decided ti was best they sat on the floor.
            </p>
            <p class="dialouge">
                “Where have you two been?”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sophie and Sansome’s mother entered the living room looking worried and stressed.
            </p>
            <p class="dialouge">
                “I turned around for one second and you two just sneak off so you don’t have to clean your room.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sophie and Sansome shrugged at the same time.
            </p>
            <p class="dialouge">

                “We’ll go up and get to it! The faster you clean, the sooner you get to watch TV.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Sophie and Sansome both groaned but did as their mother asked, by shoving everything under their bed.
                <br>

                The two spent the rest of the day watching their favorite cartoons.
            </p>

            <p class="dialouge">
                END
