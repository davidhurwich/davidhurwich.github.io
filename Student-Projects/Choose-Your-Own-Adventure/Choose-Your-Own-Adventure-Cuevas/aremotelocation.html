                Sophie and Sansome were like peanut butter and jelly. The twins did everything together.
                <br>
                It was a Saturday morning, the start of the weekend, and the twins were ready to soak up their favorite cartoons like a sponge.

                Sophie and Sansome looked up and down the house but could not find it.<br>
                
            <p class="dialouge"> "Did you check in the couch?" the two asked at the same time.</p>
            <p>
                They looked at one another and then the couch again...
