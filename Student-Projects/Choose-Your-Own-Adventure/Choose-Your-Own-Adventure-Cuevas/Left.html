                Sophie and Sansome decided to go left.
                Sophie noticed the ground was made of velvet, much like the purple velvet of the couch.
                Actually, so were the trees… and the rocks, and the mountains!
                The whole place was made of different shades of Velvet.

                Sophie and Sansome walked deeper into the plush jungle.

                “I just want to find the remote and go home” whimpered Sansome.<br>

                “Wait..Shhhhh… Did you hear that???” asked Sophie.
