The crumbs continued to crawl closer. Sophie and Sansome took several steps back as they stood before them. The crumbs, if you could call them that, were larger than they were.

“I’m Crispy,” said the first.
“I’m Crunchy,” spoke another.
“And I’m Crummmmmmbly,” followed the last. 
            </p>
            <p>
Sophie and Sansome clung to one another, nervous and taken aback by the size of the crumbly cookie. They weren’t sure they should have stuck around to find out what these crumbs wanted.

 “We know where what you’re looking for is…” scoffed Crispy. <br>
                
“Yessssss, come with us.” Crunchy motioned for the twins to follow them.
            <br>

“How would you know where our remote is?” demanded Sophie.
“Sometimes things slip through the cracks…” answered Crumbly. “Only those who have been there know” 
“It where the money collects” added Crumbly.

The twins looked at one another and then back at the crumbs.<br>
They weren’t quite sure what that meant.
