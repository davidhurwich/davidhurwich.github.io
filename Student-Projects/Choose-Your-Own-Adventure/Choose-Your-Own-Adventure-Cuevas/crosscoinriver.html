            <p>
                Sophie and Sansome cross the Coin River but before they’re on the other side they spot a trail of lint behind them.
            </p>
            <p class="dialouge">
                “Has that always been there???” asked Sansome.
                “I don’t think so” replied Sophie.
            </p>
            <p>
                The trail of lint began to gather at their feet. As they looked closer they noticed the lint had a face as well. They seemed to be squeaking as they gathered by their feet. After circling them a few times the trail began start down another path beside them.
            </p>
            <p class="dialouge">
                “Should we follow them?” asked Sophie?
            </p>
