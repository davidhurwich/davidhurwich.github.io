            <h2>Goodbye, my friend</h2>
            <p>Nothing ever prepared you for that response, but it doesn’t matter. You want to be reborn. You felt the joy in being able to walk and talk, to be able to make a friend, and enjoy the journey. You want to experience it once more on Earth.</p>

            <p>You ran up to the Grim Reaper and gave a hug. Tears falling on your cheeks, you thought “I’m going to miss the times I had with the Grim Reaper.”</p>

            <p>The Grim Reaper was in utter shock to receive a hug, and decided to hug you back. “You did well kid. It’s time for you to choose.”</p>

            <p>You looked back at the Grim Reaper and smiled at Hades.</p>

            <p>“I want to be reborn.”</p>
