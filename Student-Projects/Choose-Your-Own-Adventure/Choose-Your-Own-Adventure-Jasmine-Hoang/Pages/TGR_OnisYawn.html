            <h2>Oni's Yawn</h2>
            <p>You decided to travel across mountains. You gaze at the top of mountains and saw flying serpents and fire imps. As much as you wanted to see them closer, you knew better than to do that. You were surprised at the different types of creatures. There were even some beautiful nymphs which you would have never guessed to be here in Hell. Luckily, the Grim Reaper knew where to go so we didn’t run into any dangerous underworld creatures.</p>

            <p>All of a sudden, you heard a loud snore in a cave nearby. The Grim Reaper explained, “It’s probably the Oni. Don’t make too much noise otherwise it’ll wake up.”</p>

            <p>You nodded silently.</p>

            <p>As soon as you took one step forward, a loud screech came from a flying serpent. You snapped your head to the direction of the Oni’s cave, and heard a loud yawn. You looked at the Grim Reaper and began to get frightened.</p>

            <p>“The mountains are the Oni's territory. Either we need to take a run to a different route fast or we take a flying serpent. Which one do you want kiddo?”</p>
