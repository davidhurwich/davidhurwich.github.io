            <h2>Bright Kiddo</h2>
            <p>The Grim Reaper likes that you take heed to his warning. </p>

            <p>“Hey….you’re a bright kiddo despite only living in the hospital. Sometimes people can’t give up on what they desire to see. It’s better to leave it when there’s too much at risk. Also to answer your statement earlier….Hell is not always scary if you know when to make the right move. I’m here to guide you to Hades after all.”</p>

            <p>You grin thinking about the Grim Reaper’s compliment and continue to row the boat away to Hades’s Castle.</p>
