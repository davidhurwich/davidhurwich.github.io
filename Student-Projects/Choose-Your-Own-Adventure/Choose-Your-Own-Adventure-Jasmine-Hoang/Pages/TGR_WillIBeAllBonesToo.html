            <h2>Will I Be All Bones Too?</h2>
            <p>Nothing ever prepared you for that response, but it doesn’t matter. You want to be a Grim Reaper. You felt the joy you never experienced before with this Grim Reaper. You weren’t sure what would happen in the future, but you were willing to do whatever it takes to stay.</p>

            <p>You looked at the Grim Reaper and smiled. Then you looked back at Hades and jokingly said, “Will I be all bones too?”</p>

            <p>Hades wasn’t quite expecting that answer, but replied “Yes. All Grim Reapers look the same. Only the inner soul is different."</p>

            <p>You smiled because it didn’t matter about your appearance. What connected you to the Grim Reaper was the friendship bonded. You ran up to the Grim Reaper and gave a hug. “Thanks for being there by my side and guiding me."</p>

            <p>The Grim Reaper gently patted your head,“No problem...You did well kid….It’s time for you to choose.”</p>

            <p>You looked back at the Grim Reaper and smiled at Hades.</p>

            <p>“I want to be a Grim Reaper.”</p>
