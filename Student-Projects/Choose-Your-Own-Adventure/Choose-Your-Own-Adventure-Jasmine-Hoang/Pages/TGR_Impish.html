            <h2>Impish</h2>
            <p>For awhile, you thought it was going to be smooth-sailing from here on out.</p>

            <p>Then, a fire imp attacked the flying serpent. You could hear the fire imp cackling while the serpent was getting out of control. In an attempt to fight back, the flying serpent started to chase after the fire imp. You almost fell as the flying serpent sped up faster than you expected. The Grim Reaper managed to grab you in the nick of time.</p>

            <p>The fire imp started circling around which made you a bit dizzy. The flying serpent’s attempt to catch the fire imp was futile. You saw the fire imp closing in for another attack, and yelled to the Grim Reaper immediately. The Grim Reaper hit the fire imp with the scythe and all you could see was flames trickling away until you could no longer see it.</p>

            <p>You asked, “Don’t fire imps usually travel in groups?”</p>

            <p>“Who knows. All I know is that they’re troublemakers.”</p>

            <p>You sighed. “Yeah they sure are '', as you told yourself. Eventually you could see the castle, and was able to travel safely.</p>
