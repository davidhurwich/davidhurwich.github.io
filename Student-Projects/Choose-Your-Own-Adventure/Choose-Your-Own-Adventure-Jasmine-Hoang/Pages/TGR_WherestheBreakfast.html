            <h2>Where's the Breakfast?</h2>
            <p>You couldn’t trust a flying serpent. After all, it was the one who woke up the Oni. You decided to make a dash with the Grim Reaper into a different route. However, the Oni spotted you not too far away. The Oni felt hungry and decided to make you their breakfast.</p>

            <p>You ran and ran, but it didn’t feel like you got too far. You asked the Grim Reaper while running, “Are you sure we’re getting anywhere??”</p>

            <p>The Grim Reaper replied, “It should be correct, kid”.</p>

            <p>Suddenly, you smacked into something and fell. You wondered what you crashed into, only for you to see red skin and a horned shadow. You got pale and thought, “Oh no. This is the Oni, isn’t it? Darn I should have taken the flying serpent.”</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the Grim Reaper tried to fight off the Oni. There was no place to escape and it dawned upon you that you were gonna be the Oni’s breakfast.</p>

            <p>The Oni threw the Grim Reaper to the side and grabbed you by the head. You knew that you made the wrong choice and accepted your death.</p>
