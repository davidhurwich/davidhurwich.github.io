            <h2>Memories</h2>
            <p>You and the Grim Reaper continue to walk forwards in Sanguis Terra.
            </p>

            <p>“So...Grim Reaper...I have a question for you. Are there like a bunch of you guiding other people too? What’s that scythe for? I thought you were supposed to harvest me with it, but I don’t think I’ve seen you do anything with it except lugging it around.”</p>
            
            <p>The Grim Reaper chuckled, “Hey kiddo...calm down. Why so curious?”</p>
            
            <p>“Well .... Being stuck in the hospital bed made me curious about everything. I couldn’t walk or talk before. It’s just everything that’s happening now is new to me. I guess everything is spilling out of me. I just feel so happy to be with you.”</p>
            
            <p>“...That’s nice of you”, the Grim Reaper blurted. “Anyways, it’s not everyday you get to walk with a Grim Reaper in Hell to meet Hades. So enjoy this adventure while you can because you’ll probably forget all about it kid.”</p>
            
            <p>You thought to yourself, “I’ll forget my only friend? My only memory being in a healthy body? What if I can’t be reincarnated?”</p>

            <p>Suddenly, your thoughts snapped as you feel a stinging sensation on your ankle.”</p>
            
            <p>“Ouch! What was that?”, as you grumbled.</p>
            
            <p>The Grim Reaper turned to look and realized there was blood dripping. The Grim Reaper made a concerned face and said, “Hey kid, we have to make a run. The hellhounds are going to be after you.”</p>
            
            <p>You completely forgot about the hellhounds and decide to make a dash for who knows how far wherever you needed to go was.</p>
