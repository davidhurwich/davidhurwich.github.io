            <h2>Blood Howls</h2>
            <p>As you ran, you heard howling coming from every direction. You don’t know how many there are, but all you know is that there’s a lot.</p>

            <p>“HEY KID! KEEP ON RUNNING TILL YOU PASS THAT GATE AHEAD!”</p>

            <p>However, you were beginning to run out of energy. You never ran before, heck you couldn’t even walk. You began to slow down, panting. “I c...can’t anymore G-grim Reaper."</p>

            <p>The Grim Reaper looks you dead in the eyes and then sees the hellhounds running closer. You noticed the Grim Reaper pulling out his scythe, and battled the hellhounds.</p>

            <p>As time passed, you regained your energy. But at the same time, more hellhounds keep on coming and the Grim Reaper is getting exhausted.</p>
