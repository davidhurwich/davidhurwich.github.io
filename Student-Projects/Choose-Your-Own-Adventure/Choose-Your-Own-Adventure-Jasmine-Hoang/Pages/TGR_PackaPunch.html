            <h2>Pack a Punch</h2>
            <p>You didn’t know you even had it in you. All you could see was that the hellhounds were falling one by one. You and the Grim Reaper make a good team, both exchanging attacks on the hellhounds. You couldn’t stop the adrenaline from rising. It was such an experience to battle alongside a friend. Soon, the number of hellhounds diminished.</p>

            <p>Once you were sure that there were no more hellhounds around, you dropped to the red cracked ground. Sweat pouring down everywhere and your core burns. “Man...I d-definitely don’t want to ex-experience that ever again”, you panted.</p>

            <p>The Grim Reaper hovers over you. “Hey kiddo, you pack some punch in you. Nice job in defending yourself. But it’s too early to rest, we need to get to the gate first.”</p>

            <p>You were exhausted after the fight, but you figured the Grim Reaper was right. You got up and trudged along mindlessly. All of a sudden, you asked, “You told me to run to this gate. But where does this gate lead to exactly?”</p>

            <p>The Grim Reaper chuckled, “Welcome to Hades’s Castle kiddo.”</p>
