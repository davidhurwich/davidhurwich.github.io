            <p>“Ugh.....Why is it so cold? Did a nurse put on the AC again? I swear I explained to them that I can’t handle the cold for 15 years straight already”, as you mutter to yourself.</p>

            <p>You got up from the ground and suddenly realized that you were able to walk and talk with no problem. “Hold up.....I can walk and breathe alright? What happened to my weak constitution??" You decided to not care too much, but the growing butterflies in your belly says otherwise. You were too happy to notice your surroundings carefully. </p>

            <p>After awhile, you calmed down your inner excitement about your healthy body. You muttered to yourself once again. “I could have sworn nothing unusual happened though. I slept in the hospital bed, took all my meds, and was under a gas mask. So...where am I exactly?”</p>

            <p>You continued to question where you were while walking around mindlessly. Suddenly, you sensed a presence and whipped your head in the direction. “Who’s there?!” But, all you met was silence.</p>

            <p>“Man, I must be getting hysterical. This place is too creepy. Gosh why are there so many dead trees around this place."</p>
