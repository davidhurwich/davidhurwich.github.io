            <h2>Glowing Eyes and Caves</h2>
            <p>As you continued to row the boat, you began to enter a cave. Unsure whether this was the correct route to Hades’s castle, you glanced at the Grim Reaper for confirmation. However, you noticed a dark blur nearby. It seemed to be coming towards your boat ever so slightly, but it was moving too slowly to tell. You were getting increasingly nervous and asked the Grim Reaper what it could possibly be. </p>

            <p>The Grim Reaper replied, “Probably some anglerfish.”</p>

            <p>You gave a questionable look to the Grim Reaper, then asked, “An anglerfish here? In hell? Er... wait first of all I thought they were deep sea fishes?” You couldn’t wrap your mind around a fish from Earth is here in hell, and quickly glanced back at the dark blur. For a second, you thought you saw a human face, but decided to shrug it off and row the boat away.</p>

            <p>Suddenly you zeroed in on glowing eyes that looked at you like prey, and hurriedly told the Grim Reaper about it. The Grim Reaper said to plug your ears with anything and be on the lookout. </p>

            <p>You followed the Grim Reaper’s instructions, and immediately ripped your clothes since there was nothing around. You had a sinking feeling it was a siren, and was worried if the ripped fabric was enough to block out any siren’s voice in this echoing chamber.</p>

            <p>The glowing eyes came closer to the boat faster and faster. Next thing you know, the boat almost flipped over. You had a slight heart attack, but quickly recovered. You row the boat as fast as you could, and noticed a rocky pathway enough for you and the Grim Reaper to run away.</p>
