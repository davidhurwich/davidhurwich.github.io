            <h2>Scared of Heights</h2>
            <p>Even if you were scared of heights, there was no way you were going to stay on the Oni’s territory. Who knows what kind of powers the Oni have in the mountains.</p>

            <p>The Oni comes out of the cave, and spots you and the Grim Reaper. However, the Oni decided to ignore you both since you were already too far away in the air.</p>

            <p>The Grim Reaper commented, “I’m surprised. I thought you wouldn’t budge. Most humans I have guided are scared of heights, so this is rare. You’re one brave kid.”</p>

            <p>You held onto the Grim Reaper’s hood tightly and whispered, “I am scared….But there is no way I am staying on the Oni’s territory. I am glad I made the right choice though.”</p>
