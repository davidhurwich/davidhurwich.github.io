He tells you that he is a creature like the human created by gods, but he is living in another world. He is saving humans who are cheated by the devils who are created by the sins of humanity. The human can’t develop well enough because of sins such as
            Jealousness. The pyramids on the earth are jails used to confine the evils His job is to save other creatures who are exploited by the evils. </p>
