        <p class="wrapper">After entering a light wall, you see three gods in front of you. (The god of earth, the god of the sky and the god of water) They are telling you the truth that you were farmed by an evil and committed crimes. Afterward, the evil wiped out your memories by using his blood. However, the sins are still in your body. Therefore, you were locked into the maze and waiting for purification. Now, you can be purified and get back to your normal human life and will remember nothing, or you can choose to be trained to fight against evils.</p>
