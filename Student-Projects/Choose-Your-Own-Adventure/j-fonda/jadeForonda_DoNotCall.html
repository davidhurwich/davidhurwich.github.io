                <!-- Chapter -->
                <br>
                <p>
                    You decide to keep playing the game. The death everyone thought was accidental might actually be a murder and the killer might've murdered even more, you have an obligation to finish the game. Plus, you still need to find the other pieces of the body. It wouldn't be right to go to your friend with only four pieces.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You're not sure what to do next though as the box is empty besides the head. You do another sweep of the area just in case you dropped something in your surpirse but find nothing. The sun is almost fully set now and the lake is getting quite eerie. You don't want to stay there any longer than necessary. But can you really bring body parts home?
                </p>

                <p>
                    You decide to start heading back down the trail towards where you were dropped off, you'll decide what to do when you get home. However as you're walking a young girl comes out of nowhere and jumps in front of you.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Hello!" She cackles, eyes wildly jumping around your face, "I saw what you did he he he!"

                </p>

                <p>

                    "It's not what it looks like!" You say quickly, <em>oh no she thinks I killed him.</em>

                </p>

                <p>
                    "Hmm? No? But I've been waiting for you," she pouts, shrinking down, "I was told to wait here until someone found the head! You found the head no?" She grabs for your bag before you can react and dumps all the contents out. "HA! I knew it! You found the head you liar!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    "... Someone told you to wait for me?" Unease fills your body as what she says fully settle in your mind.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Not <em>you</em>-you! Anyone could've done it silly! Anyway, it's been about a week now and I was getting bored :( you know I'm bound though, so I can't just leave willy-nilly! Do you know how long I've been craving ice cream?! But I had to just wait here until someone unburied the stupid head. What kind of person wastes a demon's time like this? I have things to do! But I've been trapped and bound, hmph!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    You've heard of trapping a demon before but it's incredibly hard and takes at least one sacrifice depending on how powerful the demon is. You wonder if the killer really did all this just to kill you. It seems like a lot of effort to kill someone. "What are you supposed to do when you find me?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    The demon her eyes before lobbing the head back at you, "I'm supposed to help you take down some bad person, I don't know who, they said you would already know," she leaned in with a creepy smile, "are you ready?"
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    You're confused. Why would the killer want you to stop them? You're unsure of how this could benefit them in anyway, but the more you think about it you think someone else must've known about this game, someone else must be trying to stop the killer too. Maybe the killer is working with someone and they decided this was the only way to take them down? Either way, you have no other options. "I'm ready."
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Okay, I'm not sure how strong you are magically, you're looking a little weak to be honest, but there are three choices!" The demon sings happily as if she didn't just insult your whole self, "Number one! There's a song you can sing that's meant to summon a fairy to find the person you're thinking of and it'll eat them from the inside out. It's a little bit fickle because fairies are hard to control. Number two! You pour this potion over the body and it'll act like acid on the one that killed it! It's a little more complicated, if you don't pour it well enough, it'll only severely injure them so be sure to pour it everywhere! Number three! There's a spell you chant, if said correctly, will completely wipe out the killer's soul! It's effective but requires a lot of power... mmm I'm not sure you're body will be able to handle it to be honest! But those are your choices dearie, which do you chose?"
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    <em>You choose...</em>
