                <p>
                    You keep going along the path, thoughts racing. You know the right thing to do is to tell your friend. You quickly pick up your phone and dial your friend's number. It rings twice before someone picks up. Before you're able to speak, crazed laughter fills your ear.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Did you think I wouldn't tap your phone?" Is the last thing you hear before your phone and the phone from the body explode. </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the killer foiled your plans of bringing peace of mind to your friend and has killed you. Please try again. </p>
