            <!-- Chapter -->
                <p> You decide your curiousity is stronger than your fear and to keep going with the search. At the very least, this person deserves to have their parts put back together.

                    You look at all your clues and think that the only logical place to go to next is the library. You quickly call a cab and head over to the university library. It's around 3pm by the time you get to the library and it seems quite full, definitely not like the other two spots you found pieces of the body. But with no other leads you start looking around for boxes.
                </p>

                    You wander around for awhile until you feel something in your bag move. You pause and look around, you're on one of the upper floors and there aren't too many students around but you don't want to risk anyone seeing you pull out a leg and an arm so you find a quiet room before opening the bag. Inside, the arm and the leg are glowing! You know the next body part must be nearby you're just not sure where. With more of an idea now, you stow the pieces back in your bag and set out to find the next piece. You figure it has to be on this floor as the arm and leg didn't act out until this moment.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You walk around slowly until you get to a storage closet. You can feel both parts thumping around wildly and figure there must be something in there! Unfortunately, the door is locked. You know it's unethical to use magic to unlock doors, but you can't let this puzzle go unsolved. You look around before quickly unlocking the door. Inside you see a small closet with a large box inside. Without thinking, you shove the box into your bag and hurry back to the private room you were in earlier.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You use the keys again to open the box and inside you find the torso. It glowing and thumping around obnoxiously. You set the bag with the arm and the leg next to it in hopes of settling down the magical energy linking them together. It works well enough even if it's still glowing, at least it's not trying to lunge at you anymore. With a quick look, you see a very distinct tattoo on it's ribcage and freeze. You know that tattoo. You know he likes to bike around the lake on his free time, you know his brother, and you know his grave was robbed two weeks ago.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You remember his brother calling you in the middle of the night crying about how someone dug up his brother and stole the whole body.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    But it can't be? The ticket was for yesterday! The killer could've easily planted the ticket and put the wristband on the body so you wouldn't put two and two together so quickly, but still? It all seems very muddled now and you're not sure what to do next. Inside the box is the bike lock he used and a polaroid of the lake. The killer obviously wants you to go to the lake, but what if it's a trap? What if you played their game just for them to kill you now? You also want to check the cemetery where he was buried, maybe the killer left some clues as to who they are at the cemetery. It's obvious the killer is the grave robber, how else would they have the torso of someone who's been long dead?
