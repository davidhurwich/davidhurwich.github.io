                <h2 class="center"> Killer Finds You </h2>

                <p>
                    You're just not willing to risk it! You quickly put the box with the leg and the bag into your enchanted one before calling a cab. You'll go home and make the call, so that if the killer is watching it all seems normal. You need to work on that presentation anyway. You tap your leg nervously as you look out the window, <em>how much longer until I'm home? </em>
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Nervous?" The driver asks, eyeing you through the rearview mirror.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "No, ah, I have this project, it's due soon I shouldn't have waited so long to start it."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    The driver laughs, it's a bit of an odd sound, "Why did you put it off?"
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    You sit there and think about how to answer his question, "I got distracted, there are a lot of different things I'd rather be doing I guess?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    He hums in assent, "It's important to remember the rules, I guess, rules of life that is. Things that need to get done will get done and if they don't... well you'll just have to live and die with the consequences."
                </p>

                <p>
                    A shiver runs down your spine, <em>live and die... what is he on?</em> "Yeah I guess you're right."
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    "Well this is your stop, good luck with your project!"
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once inside, you say a quick enchantment wrapping the apartment in a protective shield so that no one can get in and quickly rush to your room. You have your phone in hand already dialing 9-1-1. You take one step into the room before you hear a loud gunshot and pain fills your chest. Your phone lies uselessly on the floor as you stare at the ceiling.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>"Rule number one: do not tell anyone you're playing. Such a shame, I guess I'll just have to add you to the puzzle, you're going to make this quite difficult for the next one."
                    </strong>
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the killer has found and killed you. Please try again.
