                    You decide to take a leap of faith in your strength and choose to chant the spell! As you chant the spell, you feel a fire fill your body and you can envision the killer's soul right in front of you, they're standing in a cemetery, they seem to be waiting for you! It looks like the whole game was a ploy meant to end in your death! As the chanting gets more intense, you can feel the soul start to shake. You can see the killer grasping their chest, they can feel their soul being ripped from them. When the chant ends, the killer and their soul has disappeared.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You have defeated the killer! With the help of the demon, you're able to locate the rest of the pieces of the body and are able to bury him again.
