                <p> You're walking down the street when something sparkles to your left. You look over into the alley and see something is twinkling near some boxes. Hesitantly, you walk over just to find some broken glass. Somewhat disappointed you get up to leave when you look into the boxes and see an arm! You jump back quickly in surprise before slowly approaching the box again. Hmm it looks real, you think to yourself before fully opening the box to look inside.



                    <p>There's a puddle of dried blood where the arm had been cut. The cut itself was very rough and jagged, obviously a hesitant or weak person made the cut. Curiously, you poke at the arm. It's cold. You look around for any security cameras only to find that there are none in the alley, so you were put here for a reason then. </p>



                    <p>After some searching, you find a crumpled wristband in the hand of the arm. It's a general admission wristband for a concert that happened last night at the local arena.You know there's no way you'll be able to fit the arm inside your bag without help so you say a quick enchantment that allows your bag to carry as many things as you need without growing in size or weight. You carefully put the arm inside and consider your next move. There have been a series of odd events recently that have been keeping the police busy and you've always been interested in mysteries. Would it be wrong to start this investigation off without the police? Maybe but you think you'll probably get it done faster than them anyway, plus you've been looking for a reason to not start your homework anyway! With this in mind, you decide to head to the arena and see if you can find any more clues.</p>
