            <!-- Chapter -->
                <p> 
                    You remember that the killer told you the body must be put back together and don't want to risk breaking a rule and angering them. You head over to the lake pictured as the sun starts to set. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once at the lake, you find the route he usually rides and walk around until you see a bike leaning against a tree. You haven't run into any people on the trail and find this slightly suspicious. After further inspection, you realize it's the body's bike! You look around bewildered before realizing that the pieces you have are going crazy in your bag. A piece has to be nearby!
                </p>

                <p>
                    After some searching you find the dirt nearby has been freshly placed and don't hesitate before enchanting the dirt to unpack itself. Before you know it, you find a box. You look around again, making sure no one is coming before opening the box. You let out a quick scream and drop the box along with the contents. In your haste to get away from the box, the insides have rolled out. Sitting in front of you, is the head of the person. You are now 100% sure it's your friend's brother. 
                </p>

                <p>
                   You wonder if it's right for you to keep this going. You know how much if hurt your friend to find out someone stole his brother's body but you also remember rule number one. You're not supposed to tell anyone. But doesn't he deserve to have his brother? I don't have all the pieces but I shouldn't be keeping them for myself. I should tell him. 
                </p>
