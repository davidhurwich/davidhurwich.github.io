                <!-- Chapter -->
                <br>
                <p>
                    You took choir in elementary school and decide that singing to the fairy is your best bet!
                </p>

                <p>
                    You follow the notes of the demon and sing the given lyrics. As you sing, you're suddenly transported into the eyes of a fairy. You start to think of the killer and find the fairy is floating behind the killer. They're standing in the cemetery, hidden by trees. It seems they were waiting for you! It was a trap in the end, the game could only end in your death. You feel slightly thankful that you found this demon instead. However, you are distracted and miss a key lyric and the fairy is mad you! Before you know it, a swarm of fairies is in front of you and is eating you alive!
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Ah I did say they were fickle creatures!" Is the last thing you hear before you die.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, you died before you could defeat the killer. Please try again.
