        <!-- Chapter -->
        <section>
            <p> Once you're at the venue, you walk around looking for anything suspicious. You walk towards the section where GA ticket holders are usually let in and walk around until you find another box. This box is taped closed and pushed behind a pillar. As you get closer to the box, the arm in your bag starts to shake a little. After a quick sweep of the area, you realize that, again, there are no security cameras. You rummage inside your bag and notice that the arm is glowing and seems quite agitated by something. You stop for a moment and realize that the person must've been killed by magic and the residue on each body part is reacting to each other as you put them closer together. <em>It's only natural for a body to want to be whole again, you think to yourself trying to remember everything your mother taught you.</em></p>

            <p>Curious about what's inside the box you use your keys to cut it open. Inside is a glowing severed leg. Once the box is fully open, the leg jumps at you a little before settling down in the box again. Next to the leg you find a small bag. Inside the bag you find, a phone, a portable charger, a crumpled up piece of paper, a library card for the university nearby, and unused tickets for the show last night. </p>

            <p><em>It looks like the person was grabbed here and killed before the concert,</em> you think to yourself. You check the phone and portable charger next but, unfortunately, both are dead. You grab the paper and do your best to straighten it out without ripping it before taking a quick read. </p>

            <p> <em>Hello,</em></p>



            <p><em>I see you've decided to try and put my puzzle back together! I hope you know that by starting this game, you must finish it. If you don't finish it, I'll have to add to my puzzle for the next player. There are only two rules for this game! Number one: do not tell anyone you're playing :) no one, not a soul. Not your friends, not your family, and definitely not the cops. If you decide to tell anyone, I'll be forced to end the game early and where's the fun in that? Number 2: You must put me back together again, it'd be such a shame to have parts of me floating around for someone else to find. Then they'd have to play too! And there can only be one winner... Guess you better hurry up and find me.</em></p>

            <p>For the first time today, you feel fear. It was all fun and games until the killer acknowledges you were just playing their game. Is it right to continue this? Could they really know if you called the police? How could they know with 100% certainty that you would be the one to find the arm and leg? There are very few people strong enough to cast a spell to control the urges of people around them and how likely is it that this killer is one of the few? </p>

            <p>But your curiosity is just as strong as the fear. Should you continue putting this person back together or finally bring in the professionals?</p>
