                <!-- Chapter -->
                <p>
                    You decide to not follow the killer's obvious clues that point to the lake and go to the cemetery. It takes you a moment to remember where he was buried but before you know it you're standing in front of his grave. They have the hole dug out still, but the coffin is gone. You hear something to your left and you quickly look over.
                </p>


                <p>
                    It was just a squirrel. You sigh in relief before suddenly you're being pushed into the open grave. Falling hard onto the ground, you sit stunned for a second before you feel dirt falling quickly on top of you.
                </p>



                <p>
                    You hear ominous laughter before the killer stuns you and freezes you in place. <strong>"Rule Number 2: You must put me back together!</strong> You were just going to let our dear friend float around aimlessly forever! How selfish of you, poor thing must be missing the feeling of being one piece! Well, no matter, I'll just find someone else to play."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately, the killer buries you alive and waits for you to die before fishing out your body and adding you to the puzzle. Please try again.
