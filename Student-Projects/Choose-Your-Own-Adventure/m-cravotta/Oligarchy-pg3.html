<p> Son I have some good news and bad news. Your grandfather passed away late last night. He was a great man! Greater than you will ever be, he muttered under his breath. </p>
<p> As we begin to mourn his death and honor his legacy, we need to talk about life moving forward.</p>
<p> As it stands your grandfather endowed you with a generous sum of money in hopes that you too might profit from his fortune. â€œI must say, although I do not think you are ready for that kind of money, it is waiting for you at the bank. </p>
