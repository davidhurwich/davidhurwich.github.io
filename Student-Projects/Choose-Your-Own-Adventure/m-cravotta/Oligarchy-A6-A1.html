<p> The detective lets you out with no further questions but he hands you his card and tells you to stay in touch. You decide to call a cab home to figure out what to do next. On your way home you notice that you’ve been followed by the same car for several blocks. As the cab pulls up to the house, the car behind you begins to slow down and the engine idles. Nervously you open your door, ready to race into the house. A man steps out of the car behind you “Madden Moneybags? This is a message from Freddie!” He pulls out a tommy gun and begins to fire as you bolt toward the house. Several shots ricochet off of the house before a sharp burning pain sears into your back and then another and another! You’ve been hit! </p>

<p> You lie on the ground bleeding out as the sound of screeching rubber leaves a trail of dust in the cold night’s air. </p>

<p>Sorry this is the end of the road for you Moneybags!
