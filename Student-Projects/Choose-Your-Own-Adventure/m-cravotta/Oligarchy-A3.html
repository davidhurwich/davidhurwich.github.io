<p> You find a nearby phone booth to make a call to your friend Frederick. You get him on the line and say “Oh buddy ol’ pal! I have come across a great sum of money! I was wondering if you had some ideas on what to do with such a goldmine!” </p>

<p class="padding"> Fred doesn’t hesitate for a moment, “Oh what wonderful timing, I’ve got just the proposition for you but I can’t tell you over the phone, let’s meet in person”
