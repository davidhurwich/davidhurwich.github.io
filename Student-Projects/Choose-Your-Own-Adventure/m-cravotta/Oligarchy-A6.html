<p> You decide to pay the congressman a visit. You arrive at city hall with a briefcase full of money. The secretary asks “what’s your business sir?” and you say that you are to meet with JP Wellington regarding a very important matter. In a moment, he calls you into his office. </p>

<p> The meeting is wildly successful and you enter into an agreement regarding taxes and so much more. “This will be a very lucrative partnership indeed,” says Wellington as he lights a cigar to commemorate the occasion. </p>

<p>It seems like you’ve got the golden ticket, the perfect synthesis of business and government. You continue your days shipping goods east and west. When workers strike you have the full backing of the government to squash protests. Your money doubles and triples, soon you have made tenfold what you started. It looks like you’re on a path to luxury and great wealth. </p>

<p> Congratulations, you and your cronies are super rich and everyone else is poor! </p>
