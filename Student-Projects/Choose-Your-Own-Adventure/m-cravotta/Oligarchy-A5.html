<p> You’ve had enough fun for the night and business is more important. You decide to reconvene in the morning when you are fresh. </p>
    
<p> The next morning you meet Fred at the docks where he shows off his fleet of cargo ships. Clouds of black smoke billow from the massive steel beasts as they enter the harbor, it is quite the spectacle. </p>

<p> Fred tells you that he has a deal in the works with Pennsylvania Railroad to offload shipments and carry them to the West Coast. “The only problem is these damned regulators have been trying to tax me on the interstate commerce for years! I need a sweet deal for our congressman to keep his filthy mouth shut about this and let us slide this one time on the tax, what do ya say?”
