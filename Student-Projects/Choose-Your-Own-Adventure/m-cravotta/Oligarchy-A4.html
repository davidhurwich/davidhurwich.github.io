<p> You meet your friend Frederick at the juice joint for a few whiskeys to talk about the business proposal. He tells you that he has a shipping business that could use an extra investment. He doesn’t specify exactly what they’re shipping but it sounds lucrative. </p>

<p class="padding"> He says that in order to open up some new routes, he might have to pull a few strings and could use a partner in the endeavor. He says, “of course, if you’re not up for making a little extra money on the side, I guess we could live for the night and see where it takes us”
