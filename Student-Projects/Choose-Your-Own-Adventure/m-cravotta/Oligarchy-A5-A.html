<p> You decide to put the business aside and live for the moment. You buy the most expensive bottle of whiskey on the shelf and pass shots around the room. Soon you and Fred are approached by some fine young dames from across the bar. They seem to be trying to seduce you and by god, you’re in no place to resist. 
    
<p> They say to you, “hey, let’s blow this joint and find somewhere more fun.” The four of you leave in a drunken stupor to go back to their hotel. The rest of the night gets foggy quickly and before you know it you’ve woken up in jail. </p>

<p> Sorry, looks like your luck has run out Mr. Moneybags, you ended up broke and in the joint!
