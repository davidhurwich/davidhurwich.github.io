                All my life I have been a bystander.<br><br>
                Finally, now, I realize the mistakes I have done throughout my life. Avoiding to take action has always been the easiest option for me. Less struggle, less hassle but I finally get it now. I see an opportunity to make things right.<br><br>

                I make to the door. I have nothing on my mind outside of helping my daughter and finally facing my past and the consequences I deserve related to it.<br>
                I am ready to start over.<br>
                I turn the knob. I get out. <br><br><br>
                Everything is dark. It seems like a tunnel.
