                If I am locked in this room, it might mean that it should be a code related to my own life experience.<br><br>
                I tried my birthday, nothing happened. I tried the day of my wedding and also the day of my daughterâ€™s birthday. I thought these would have been good choices, but then, I get why they were not the right answers. <strong>I was never mentally present for either of them.</strong> I only ever just watched them as they passed. <strong>I was a bystander.</strong> I wish I could have done more for them rather than getting a divorce and having my daughter taken away.<br><br>
                I am starting to think that positive events are not going to be my solutions. Maybe, for the first time, I should face my past.<br><br><br>
                What life experiences though?
