                Next question then...<br><br>
                "IT IS THE END OF THE DAY. YOU ARE RIDING THE TRAIN HOME. THE CAR YOU ARE RIDING IN IS PACKED FULL OF MANY PEOPLE. OUT OF THE CORNER OF YOUR EYE, YOU SEE A MAN AND A WOMAN TOGETHER, HAVING A TENSE CONVERSATION PRIVATELY. DESPITE SEEMING TO BE FAMILIAR TOWARDS EACH OTHER, THE WOMAN DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THE MAN. IT IS NOT LONG BEFORE THE MAN BEGINS TO USE STRONG PHYSICAL FORCE ON THE WOMAN. IT SEEMS TO HAVE ESCALATED, BUT NO ONE IN THE CAR IS REACTING OR CHOOSING TO INTERVENE.<br><br><br>

                WHAT WILL YOU DO?"
