IN JUST A SHORT WHILE YOU WILL BE EXPECTED TO PRESENT AN IMPORTANT PRESENTATION THAT WILL EITHER LAUNCH YOUR CAREER INTO CERTAIN SUCCESS OR WILL DESTROY IT. YOU HAVE NO MOMENTS TO SPARE. YOU SEE, ON THE GROUND A FEW FEET AWAY, A MISPLACED CREDIT CARD. THERE SEEMS TO BE NO ONE AROUND. YOU CAN GO RETRIEVE IT, PERHAPS TO RETURN IT TO ITS OWNER IN THE NEAR FUTURE, BUT IN DOING SO YOU WILL MISS YOUR PRESENTATION.<br><br>

                WHAT WILL YOU DO?"
