                    You go to Scotland Yard the next day to gather more clues.  Watson is still nowhere to be seen.  Scotland Yard informs you that there is a murderer on the loose!  A female in her 30s was murdered in the slums last Monday and they have yet to find the murderer.  However, there are 2 men that that are potential suspects.  You decide to investigate further...Is it Suspect A, Suspect B, or neither???
