                        You arrive at the second address, and you see the butcher not far ahead. You yell to him and he looks surprised to see you. As you look closely, you see that there is a frightened woman next to him and he's holding a butcher's knife. Using the butcher's shock to her advantage, the woman runs off. He's the killer!! You quickly grab your gun and shoot him in the leg, holding him until members of Scotland Yard arrive. London is safe for another day...
