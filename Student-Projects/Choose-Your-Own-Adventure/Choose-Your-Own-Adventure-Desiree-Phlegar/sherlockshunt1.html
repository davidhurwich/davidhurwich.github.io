                    You arrive home after spending all night at the London Symphony, listening to your favorite Violin player.  You see a strange package by the door addressed to you.  You pick it up and enter.  Watson must not be home, or else he would've picked the package up.  You open it....it contains a strange piece of meat.  Doesn't look like beef....This calls for further investigation....
