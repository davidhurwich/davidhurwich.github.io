               You decide that you value your life too much to risk helping the man. You sneak past while the aliens are distracted with their "surgery". You hear the mans yells as the aliens are taking him apart. You try your best to stay composed, muffuling out his screams. You make it past the research room without being detected and make your way to another room. Inside you find what looks like the emergency escape room equipped with escape pods. A wave of relief washes over you as you set coordinates to Eath. You are free.
