                You awaken, feeling drowsy and disoriented with no idea of where you are or how you got here. You look around the room that resembles a hospital. You look out the window, all you see are stars. You come to the realization you are somewhere in deep space. Panicked, you look around the room for answers. You come across two paths, one that goes straight and the other going to the right. Which one do you choose?
