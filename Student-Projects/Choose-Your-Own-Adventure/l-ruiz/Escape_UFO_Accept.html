            You try to take in about what the man has requested from you and you think to yourself " I need to do this for the greater good". You accept his request and make your way towards the engine room. You make it to the engine room that is surprisingly unguarded, I guess they didn't expect anyone to sacrafice themselves. You aim you gun at the engine, let out a scream and fire. The engine explodes,death is certain but it is okay you are at peace with your decision.The ship explodes, you die a hero's death.
