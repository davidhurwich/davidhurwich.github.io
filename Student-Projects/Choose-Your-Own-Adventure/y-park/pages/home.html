        <p> I'm home with my daughter. I'm trying to think it's okay at least I am home and my daughter is by my side. I give her a warm hug. I feel better again. My daughter is sleeping. I'm asleep. I tried to forget today’s accident.  Maybe I am in my dream. No, oh wait, is it a dream? Too vivid and clear...let me go check the time. What time is it? I woke up and found the clock.
Something is wrong with the clock. Clock is ticking very fast and loud.Seriously...what’s wrong?
Holy crap! Clock is running backwards so fast! What? Why is the clock going backwards…I am so confused.
