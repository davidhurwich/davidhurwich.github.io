        <p>  I opened the door. People are weird. Growling...Oh shoot! They are running  to us. Look at them, they crawl to us…Weird deer-like posture...Broken joints, bleeding. 
“What is going on !!!”
We are all frightened.Is it like a virus…? I think they are all infected by the deer I hit. They suddenly and crazily run to us. Don’t ever look back, just run!
One of the four falls down and I try to help her out, pulling her hand.Oh no.. she is bitten.Infected
I am dying!!! We, three of us, run crazily to the restroom and lock the door. We hide into a restroom holding our breath. 

"We need to  get out of here. We need to find our driver, we need to find the key.
"I'm so scared. How can we get a key?"
"Let's lure them”, one of us said. 
“We have to find a driver first and get the key from the driver."


“Oh there! There is a driver” I could see the driver through the crack of the door. Everybody is scattering around.
We are waiting for them to fall asleep. Daylight is gone… It is so dark outside. They are growling and moving like a deer. We are waiting for them to fall asleep.
Few hours later, no sound is coming out of the resting area. We assume everyone is sleeping. We opened the restroom door and looked around. Everyone looks dead. Deep sleep. There's a driver on the ground left side of the table. Worrying about my daughter who is in the bus sleeping alone, I volunteer myself to get the key from the driver. I take my shoes and jackets off. Make my body light. Okay, I am ready. I get closer to the driver quietly praying for myself...The driver is snoring loudly. Luckily, thanks to his loud snoring sound, no one is catching my movement. 
Uh! A small loop is visible in the pocket of the driver
The key !!! I approach it carefully…
