        <p> I come back to the restroom silently. "Let's move out of the building". We sneak out to the door. “HEY” one of the zombies calls us...Holy Crabb!!! We are running as fast as we could and finally we reach the bus. I quickly open it up with the key. Everyone gets in quickly. Safe! We lock the bus door. Zombies are running towards us. I drive the bus right away. I saw my daughter still sleeping on her seat. I am so relieved and happy. Everything will be okay...We are all lucky. Lucky to escape out of weird resting area, lucky to go back sweet home sweet! 
++++ Successfully Escape out of the Zombies +++++
