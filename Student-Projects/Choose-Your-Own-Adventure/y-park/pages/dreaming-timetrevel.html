I took a deep breath and tried to focus on what was happening. I tried to think... ‘What is so scary, man?’ I am walking again to the bedroom where my daughter sleeps.  No, I'm walking into the clock...wait I don't want to, but can't help!
 What should I do? Oh, I'm so dizzy. Finally time stopped and I am here at a time when I hit the deer.
And thought... I can stop my car, I can cut off the situation.Then I never have to feel guilty anymore...There I see myself coming.. driving roughly and I see a deer passing through the bushes! At that moment, I am running ahead of my car, I am shouting out, “stop!!!” Oh, shoot. I couldn’t stop hitting a deer. Few seconds later, BANG! The moment I hit the deer, the deer was out of breath. Red blood flows into the dark road. And another me who is from the past, went home ignoring the deer. A deer is dead with eyes opened. 
Suddenly he starts to breathe again and walks back to the darkness with his joints broken.   With the blood smeared and bones crushed, he disappeared. What is it?
“Dad..? Dad!!” My daughter wakes me up and I knew it was a dream…so horrible and creepy. What the hell was it? I wake up from the bed and run to the clock and it is all good. Nothing strange. I feel like the dream I dreamt just happened to me in real.
