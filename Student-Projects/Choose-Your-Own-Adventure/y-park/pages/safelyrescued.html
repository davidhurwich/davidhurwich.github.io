        <p>  She says, “Don't get off the bus, let's just watch for a while. It is very unusual...even the deer in the middle of the herd looks something wrong. 
We should not touch them. We need to report this situation to the animal rescue center/foundation and they would take action on it”. Nobody would say no. We agreed with her and one of our passengers called the animal rescue center and reported what is happening in the middle of the road. Here we go, the rescue team arrived. They professionally rescue one by one. We were all relieved. We all happily went on a bus trip. My daughter and I had a wonderful time. I hope the herd is doing good now.
