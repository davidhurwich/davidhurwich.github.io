            I am an ordinary salaryman and I have an adorable daughter. I just I am an ordinary salaryman and I have an adorable daughter. I just finished my work. It was a long long day and I am so tired. I am going to pick my daughter up at daycare. Oh wow...I am facing too much traffic, I would rather find a faster way to meet her. On my navigation, I found the quickest way. I have never tried this way before. The way I am driving is so compact, narrow and dark. There is no light. I am speeding up and suddenly,
BANG!
I hit something...something alive. 
I am so embarrassed and scared. What should I do? Should I check what it is? Or just ignore and get going? Nobody is here I guess.. Only meâ€¦ and so dark...I hesitated for a few minutes and I finally decided.
