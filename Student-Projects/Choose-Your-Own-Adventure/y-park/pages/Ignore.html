        <p>I'm scared… What if I killed a human...? I am not sure what it was...My heart is frozen, I don’t know what I should do. I won’t check what it was. No more delays, I am heading to my daughter. 20 minutes later, I finally arrive at daycare.I'm going home with my daughter. It's okay... At least I see my daughter's smile. I feel better again. I try not to think of it. Let’s just forget about it. It is okay. No one was there watching me. This wasn’t my intention. This was an accident… a small accident...
