        <p>I'm scared… What if I killed a human...? I don't know what it is...I won’t check what I bumped into.No more delays, I am heading to my daughter. 20 minutes later, I finally arrive at daycare.I'm going home with my daughter. It's okay... At least I see my daughter's smile. I feel better again. We finally arrived home.
