        <p> Today we go on a bus trip. Sunny and bright. While bus is on the road, I see a herd of deer right in the middle of the road. Driver is not so sure and he says he has never seen a deer herd before. When we get close…
 Oh shoot! A deer I hit yesterday? The deer was surrounded by the herd. What is it? All passengers on the bus were surprised and curious.
One of them shouted, “Look at the one in the middle! Something is wrong, we should rescue the deer”.
Another passenger says,“I know..his joint might got injured! I should check him”.
Luckily, one of our team passengers is an animal activist/ protector and she is willing to check if the one is ok. She will check..
