        <p> One of the passengers gets off the bus and gets closer. She is approaching carefully and slowly from a far distance, mimicking a sound of deer.
What’s next? It's weird.. Oh my goodness deers are surrounding her and threatening her. What should we do? We kept watching the moment. Nobody bravely takes action. That  creepy deer, who’s joints and bones are broken and bleeding, bite her. She screams and runs to the bus without noticing her shoes off. Deers are chasing her. The bus driver is embarrassed and reluctantly opens the door. She eventually gets on the bus, and the herd disappears instantly. We were all worried but no one could do anything… She says she is fine. She needs to get medical treatment as soon as possible. Driver says we are heading to the area where we can go to the restroom and to have medical treatment. 
 

I  think I heard a growling sound near her seat. Others don't care at all... I carefully watched her for a moment. The bus finally arrived at the resting area. But the rest area was very old and nobody was there. The bus driver tells us to use the restroom. 
We will have free time and meet in twenty minutes. She is going to the medical room. I hope someone is there and helping her out. She does not come out. Is she still in the medic room? One of the passengers says he would go and check and bring her back. Then he does not come out either. So few other passengers including the bus driver went to the medical room again.
What? Again, they did not come out. We have been waiting for them for more than 30 minutes. Four people left including myself. Oh wait, I didn’t count my daughter who is sleeping inside of the bus. Anyways, we four now are going inside of the medical room. I am so scared. I wish I could just call the police or anywhere to get some help out of this situation. But nothing is working… Too old, too rural.. Phone is not working. Bad signal. We all get off the bus, heading to the medical room. I hear a sound inside the room. Why aren't these people coming out?
