        <p> Today we go on a bus trip. Sunny and bright. I see a herd of deer right in the middle of the road. Driver is not so sure and he says he has never seen a deer herd before. When we get close…
 Oh shoot! A deer I hit yesterday? The deer was surrounded by the herd. What is it? All passengers on the bus were surprised.
One of them shouted, “Look at the one in the middle! Something is wrong, we should rescue the deer”.
Another passenger says,“I know..his joint is injured! I should check him ”.
Luckily, one of our team passengers is an animal activist and she is willing to check if the one is ok. She will check..
