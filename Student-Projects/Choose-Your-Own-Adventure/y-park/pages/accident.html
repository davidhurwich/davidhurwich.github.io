        <p> I finally got out of the car. As I get closer, I could feel my heart beating faster. With an iphone flashlight, I am watching what I bumped into. Oh my goodness, it was a deer. 
‘It is just a deer, no one saw it. I am all good’
I returned to a car ignoring a deer who was barely breathing and bleeding so much. I am passing the deer down the road and I feel...definitely guilty. I looked back through the back mirror. Nothing is seen… It is too dark.
Oh wait, I think I saw something. 
‘What was it? Was there anyone? I am not sure.. I keep compromising that nobody saw what I was doing and it was an accident. 
I arrived at my daughter’s daycare and met her. When I saw her smile, my worries, hard times and everything was gone.
