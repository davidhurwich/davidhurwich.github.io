                <p>We have always been fascinated by the thought of alien life elsewhere in the universe. Unfortunately various entities, governments, and politicians globally have been hiding information from the public in order to execute their ambitious plans. A few years ago one of these organizations captured a creature in one of their expeditions. This creature had in its possession new and more advanced technology and it was the perfect opportunity to use this new discovery and control the world and other civilizations. </p>


                <p>But the plan went wrong. This creature was not alone and others are coming for its rescue. They are mad and they have decided to invade our planet. Humanity is in danger and now it is time to make our best decisions to survive.</p>
