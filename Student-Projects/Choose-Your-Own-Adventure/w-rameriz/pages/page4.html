                <p>Aliens are coming!</p>
                <p>That was the message. Thousands of alien spaceships have been detected by the radars. They are approaching fast to the earth. Our planet might soon be under an imminent attack.</p>
                <p>We do not know their intentions yet, but they are coming to rescue one of their members who has been captured by the government during a secret mission to the space.</p>
                <p>We have never seen anything like this before. Everything seems that it has been taken from a film.</p>
                <p>How would you react?</p>
