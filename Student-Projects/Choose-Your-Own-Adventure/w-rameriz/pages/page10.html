                <p>Aliens began to attack main cities around the world. Governments are trying to respond to the attack, but they are also trying to protect the people.</p>
                <p>Things are not looking good. In order to get protection from the government you must follow some directions. Unfortunately, capacity is limited and only some people would be able to survive in case of a massive attack.</p> 
                <p>Do you think following instructions would be a good idea? or should you stop wasting time and try find a way to survive?</p>
