                <p>The invasion has started!</p>
                <p>You look up to the sky and see something you have never seen before.</p>
                <p>You are trying to contact your friend or your family. It seems that everyone is doing the same and the networks are collapsing.</p>
                <p>You have tried many times and finally someone answers but after a few seconds you got disconnected. You don’t know if the other person heard what you said, “come to my house”.</p>
                <p>You can stay in your house hopping the person would come or you could go and find that person.</p>
                <p>What would you do?</p>
