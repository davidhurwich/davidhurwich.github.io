            <p>A few minutes later, a woman who looks like in the mid-30s, black long hair with her lab coat came out of the door.  </p>
<p>Sherlock: "Good evening. We want to ask about the incident that the guy was killed by a magical creature. I heard that you are the scientis."</p>
<p>Woman: "Yes. I'm Julia. Julia Westfield. Please, come on in."
Three of them went into her house and sat on the sofa. 
She poured some tea and start talking.

<p>Ms. Westfield: "I am combining dinosaur's DNA with magical creatures for their evolution. I take some small amount of blood from dinosaurs and inject to the magical creatures. If you put inject too much, they lose their body control and could be manipulated by human voice. Take a look at my friends."</p>
             <p>She took them to the basement. There were three magical creatures.</p>
        
        <p>She took them to the basement. There were three magical creatures.</p>
<p>Ms. Westfield: "This is a kelpie. She has a crack on her tail for a few days ago. And this is a phoenix. His wings also got injured in this few days. And last, this is Cerberus and she is growling than usual...I think because they have a scar on their head..."</p>
<p>Sherlock took out the stone that the old lady gave him.</p>
