            <p>Sherlock: "Thank you for your cooperation. That's it for all. Since we came here far away from the human world, I am interested in this castle architecture. Can you guide us around the castle? I'm sure you know everything in here."
The king: "Sure. I'm happy to guide you guys. Come follow me."
We left the huge hall with the king. The king left the guards because the castle inside is safe. 
:
While they were walking, the king told us each room.
The king: "This room is my collection of the magical stone...this room is my research room...and..."
Suddenly, he stopped walking.

            <p>The king: "Detective Sherlock, I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you the truth in that hall but I couldn't. I've done a thing that against Skyland rule that day. If the guards know, I have to proclaim the abdication."
Sherlock: "Tell me the truth."
The king: "There is a rule that Skyland residents are not allowed to go down to the land. And I broke that rule. Not only this time. I've done many times."
Nick: "For what?"
Sherlock: "To meet his friend, right?"
The king: "You're right. My friends, not only Chunky but also other dragon friends are living on the land. Let me tell you briefly about my life. I was born in China but because of my scarlet hair, nobody loved me, even my parents. One day, I picked up an old book on the street and I was lost in the magical world in a moment. Nobody knows I'm a foreigner. I didn't know how to survive on the land but this one large dragon with beautiful strong wings saved me. They treated me nicely. I learned magic spells in the old book and how to survive in this world. Later, I saved the previous king's life when I visited Skyland and I became the next king in Skyland."
Sherlock: "So what happened that night?"
The king: "I...I...I don't know."
Nick: "What do you mean you don't know?"
The king: "I remember I went down to see my friends as usual after 10 pm and chatting with them. But...the next thing I remembered was I was in my bed the next morning and..."
