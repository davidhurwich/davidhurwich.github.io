            <p>They found a guy hiding in the bushes with a bleeding arm. His face was pale and seems like he lost a lot of blood. Watson gave the person the first aid.  There were numerous large footprints everywhere.</p>
            <p>Man: "Thank you whoever saved my life."</p>
            <p>Watson: "No problem. You look better now. By the way, What are you doing here?"</p>
            <p>Man: "Sorry. I, I, I'm Nick, I'm CEO of Geegle. I, I, I was heading down to the way home, oh I live in San Francisco, and I bumped into this weird old lady and the next thing, I was lost in this forest! Since I was walking around the forest, I stepped on the dinosaur's egg accidentally. They got mad and attacked me. That's why I had this deep wound. I couldn't move these few days."</p>


<p>Suddenly, BAM!! BAM!! BAM!! The loud noise was coming toward them. It was a dinosaur. "RUN! RUN!" They ran as fast as they can, but Nick fell because he had anemia. Sherlock and Watson couldn't leave Nick behind so they return to save him but the dinosaur is getting closer and there is no way to hide!!
