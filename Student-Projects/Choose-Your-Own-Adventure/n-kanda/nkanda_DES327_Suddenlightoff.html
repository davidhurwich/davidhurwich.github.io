            <p>Suddenly the light went off. Everybody was panicked except Sherlock. He predicted that the suspect is going to kill the king because the king was just talking about the jikentoujitu and the light went off. Which means the king knows or saw something on the crime scene. The king will be a disadvantage to the suspect. And this is the best timing to kill because of numerous guests. The suspect is going to hide after he killed the king.</p>
