            <p>Sherlock solved this magical mystery case.
The king thanked them to arrest the suspect and the magical creatures were enjoying the party again. Ms. Westfield said she is going to stay at the party, so they said goodbye.
                They cuffed Nick and used the last wish to go home. </p>

<p>BOOOOOOOM!
They were back in England!
    Sherlock and Watson soon head to the police and send Nick to jail.</p>
<p>Watson: "But how do we prove that Nick killed the guy? Are we going to say he used the magical creature?" </p>
<p>Sherlock: "I gave them Nick's bank statement and the blackmail that the guy sent to him. We need to do in this world's way."</p>
            <p>Watson: "Hahaha true."</p>

<p>Sherlock and Watson went back home as if they solved the mystery as usual.
    There is no case that Sherlock cannot solve!!</p>
