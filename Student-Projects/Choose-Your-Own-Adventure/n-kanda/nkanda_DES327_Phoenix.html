            <p>Sherlock decided to heal Phoenix's wing. 
                The broken wing healed gradually and he seems happy.</p>
            <p>Ms. Westfield: "Thank you. Thank you. I don't know how you did that.Thank you. I would love to help you guys to solve the mystery. I can help with science field."</p>
<p>Sherlock: "Sounds great. Oh, one more question. How do you know which area is a dinosaur's territory? Because we were chased by dinosaurs a few hours ago, so I was curious about that."</p>
<p>Ms. Westfield: "Well, if you get closer to their territory, it is obvious they are lot of large footprints. I won't go if I see numerous footprints."</p>
            <p>Sherlock: "I see. Thanks. Do you know where or who the suspect is by any chance, Ms. Westfield?"</p>
<p>Ms. Westfield: "You can meet Zeus.He will definitely give you some clue. Phoenix will take you to him."</p>
            <p>They grabed Phoenix's belly and hold tight. Phillip flew to the sky.
