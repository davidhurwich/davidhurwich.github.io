            <p>Old lady: "Thank you for your help. You might be the famous private detective, Sherlock Holmes Jr?"</p>
            <p>Sherlock: "Yes, I am."</p>
<p>Old lady: "I was finding you. You need to solve the mystery. Otherwise, the principle of the nature will be destroyed."</p>

<p>Sherlock: "Tell me more about it."</p>
            <p>Old lady: "Go to magical world. Here, I'll give you my magical stone. You can make 3 wishes on the stone. But don't forget. <strong>YOU CAN ONLY MAKE 3 WISHES.</strong> Be careful what kind of wish to make. If you get lost in the woods, try to go to this magical tree. It will guide you to solve the mystery."</p>
<p>Sherlock and Watson thought the old lady is saying a lie because the stone that she gave looks just a usual rock that exist in anywhere, round, gray rock. Besides, what is a magical tree?</p>
            <p>Sherlock: "Well, thank you. I'll take it with me."</p>
<p>Old lady: "Have a safe journey and good luck."
