            <p>They were in front of a magical tree, shining brightly in the dark with a white sprinkle. As they get close by the magical tree, they realized there is a teddy bear sitting next to the magical tree. Sherlock glanced at it. Suddenly, </p>
            <p>Teddy bear: <strong>"WHY ARE YOU STARING AT ME? IS SOMETHING ON MY FACE?"</strong> speaking in a low husky voice. The teddy bear stand up by himself and got rid of the dust.</p>
<p>Teddy bear: "I'm a fairy that protect this magical tree. I know you guys wanna go home but you have to solve the mystery that happened in this world.<strong>THE GUY WAS KILLED BY THE CREATURE IN THIS MAGICAL WORLD.</strong> "</p>
            <p>Sherlock: "Why are you so sure the magical creature is involved in that case?"</p>
<p>Teddy bear: "Because I had a prophecy that something bad things are going to happen and it will threaten the balance between the human and magical world. We just want each world to be peaceful but somebody is trying to break down this system. We can use a magic spell but we are not almighty, so we need your genius brain, detective, Sherlock Holmes."</p>
<p>Sherlock: "All right. I'll undertake it. Do you have any place to think where should we find a suspect?"</p>
<p>Teddy bear: "There is a scientist who is testing and creating hybrid magical creatures. The magical tree is going to illuminate the path to the scientist's house. Follow the path. Good luck."
