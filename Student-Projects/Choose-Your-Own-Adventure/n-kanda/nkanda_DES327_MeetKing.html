            <p>They followed the little dragon and they walked down the hall. The man was sitting on the sapphire chair. He is the king. He looked in his 20s, tall, and skinny.</p>
<p>Sherlock: "Good afternoon. I'm Sherlock Holmes Jr. I'm investigating this case that the man was killed by a magical creature. I wanted to ask a few questionss."</p>
<p>The king: "Oh I heard about that case...It was a terrible case. Well, I'm happy to answer some questions but there will be a large party tonight, so please be fast."</p>
<p>Sherlock: "Sure. Where were you 2 days ago around midnight?"</p>
<p>The king: "Two days ago? You mean the day the man was killed? I went to sleep at 10 pm as usual in my bed."</p>
            <p>Sherlock: "Why are you so sure that you went to bed at 10 pm?"</p>
<p>The king: "I always play chess with my friend, Chucky at 9 pm and usually finish the game within an hour. Oh, Chucky is the little dragon that leads you guys to my place." </p>
<p>Sherlock felt the king was hiding something. He seemed deeply disturbed by the question that Sherlock asked.
