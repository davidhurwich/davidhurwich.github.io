            <p>Sherlock arrested the king's guard.</p>
            <p>The king: "Why are you arresting my guard, Sherlock!?"</p>
            <p>Sherlock: "Because he is the one who killed the man by manipulating magical creature"</p>
            <p>The king: "What?"</p>
<p>Sherlock: "When the king started to talk about the truth in the balcony, this guard was staring at us. I guess he was trying to listen to the story because he needs to be sure how much he remembers about the crime scene.And he decided to kill him before he says something disadvantage to you." </p>
            <p>The king: "I cannot believe you killed the guy and also trying to kill me!?</p>
<p>The guard: "No king! Detective, you are wrong. You are misunderstanding! You need to listen to me!"</p>
<p>The king didn't listen to the guard's words.
Eventually, the guard was put into jail. Sherlock stopped the next incident. The king was safe now. The king thanked them to arrest the suspect and the magical creatures were enjoying the party again. Ms. Westfield said she is going to stay at the party, so they said goodbye.

Sherlock was not 100% sure if she was the suspect. 
But it's time to go home. </p>
