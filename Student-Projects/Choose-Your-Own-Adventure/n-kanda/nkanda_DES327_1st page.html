            <p>Sherlock Holmes Jr. was living in the England. 
                One day, Sherlock Holmes was sitting on his sofa and drinking his favorite coffee; as usual at his house. They did not have a mysterious case recently, so they were bored. Watson was looking through the newspaper to search for new incidents that Sherlock might be interested in. </p>

            <p>Suddenly, Watson "Sherlock! Look at this article!" He seems excited.
                It says, </p>
            <p class="end">"THE MEN WERE MURDERED BY LARGE SCAR"</p>
            <p>
    "and large red feather was left in the crime scene"</p>
            <p>Watson: "Sherlock, what do you think about this case?"</p>
            <p>Sherlock: "Well, I guess someone killed them with a large weapon, like "</p>
    <p>Watson: "Really? I think somebody used an animal to kill the three men because they had LARGE SCARS, Why don't we check out the crime scene since we are free this afternoon?"</p>
