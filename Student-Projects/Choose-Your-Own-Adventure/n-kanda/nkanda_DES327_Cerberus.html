            <p>Sherlock decided to heal Cerberus's head.
                </p>
<p>Ms. Westfield: "Thank you. Thank you. I don't know how you did that. I would love to go with you guys to solve the mystery. I can help with science things."</p>
<p>Sherlock: "Wonderful. Oh, one more question. How do you know which area is a dinosaur's territory? Because we were chased by dinosaurs, so I was curious about that."</p>
<p>Ms. Westfield: "Well, if you get closer to their territory, it is obvious they are lot of large footprints. I won't go if I see numerous footprints."</p>
            <p>Sherlock: "I see. Well then, where shall we go next?</p>
            <p>Ms. Westfield: "Let'a meet Hades, the god of the underworld. He might give us some hint."</p><p>They ride on to Cerberus and he ran to the underworld.
