The light turned off suddenly. 
When the lights turned on, there was the king laying down on the floor with blood. He was stabbed. 
Sherlock looked around. One of the king's guard was holding a knife. 
Nick saw that too and he captured the guard.
                Watson tried to suppress the hemorrhage, but the blood is still bleeding.</p><p> 
The king: "Thank you, detective, Sherlock...please stay to help some other unsolved cases in the magical world...and Nick..you captured the suspect...Please be the next king...It is my last wish..."</p><p>
The king died.
Magical creatures cried for an hour and gave a funeral.
As the king said, Nick became the next king of Skyland.
                Sherlock became a private detective in the magical world.</p>
