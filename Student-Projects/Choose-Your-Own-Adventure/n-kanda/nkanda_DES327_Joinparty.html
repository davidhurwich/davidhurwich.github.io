            <p>Sherlock: "Thank you for your cooperation. That's it for all. Since we came here far away from the human world, I am interested in the party here. Can we join the party?"</p>
<p>The king: "Sure. Please feel free to help yourselves. The party will start soon."</p>
<p>The party was filled with many magical creatures. There were rare foods that they never saw in England and weird music. 
Maid: "Would you like some drink?"
