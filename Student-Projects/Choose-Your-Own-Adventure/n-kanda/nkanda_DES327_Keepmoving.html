            <p>Sherlock and Watson were walking near the off-street, somebody pressed behind them. It was sudden, so they couldn't see the person's face. They were to stumble over something and fell to the off-street. 

            <p>They felt they fell into the hole. Their bodies were falling and they felt the gravity until they dropped to the fluffy yellow grass. They looked around. The sky, everything seems different from England. There was some creature that they only saw in the fantasy such as fairies, unicorns, and goblins. They still couldn't understand what they see in their eyes.</p> 
        <p>Sherlock: "... I guess we are lost in the magical world...I don't see any exit to go home...we should move on.<p>
        
<p>They started to walk in the yellow grass without thinking about what will the next thing happen. 
Then, they found a big footprint, blood, and figure who was running away.
