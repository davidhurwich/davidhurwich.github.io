            <p>The night in the magical world was really dark that they barely see around except the illuminated path.</p> <p>GAsaGASA </p><p>They heard creepy noises instead. Walking about 20 minutes, there was one small house surrounded by large red mushrooms with white dots. The house was subtly brighter than the sky and white spores were flying. </p>
<p>Nick: "Do you guys really think somebody is living in this house? It's so creepy. I can't stand here."</p>
<p>Watson: "Well, maybe the scientis feels comfortable living in this place."</p>
<p>
 There is slightly a light inside the house.
