            <p>Sherlock arrested Ms. Westfield.</p>
            <p>Ms. Westfield: "Why are you arresting me, Sherlock!?"</p>
            <p>Sherlock: "Because you are the one who killed the man by manipulating magical creature"</p>
            <p>Ms. Westfield: "What? No!! I didn't kill anybody!"</p>
<p>Sherlock: "You wanted to test how good your experiment was with the magical creatures. When the king started to talk about the truth, you need to be sure how much he remembers about the crime scene. And you decided to kill him before he says something disadvantages you." </p>
            <p>Ms. Westfield: "No you are wrong. You need to listen to me!"</p>
<p>Eventually, Ms. Westfield was put into jail. Sherlock stopped the next incident. The king was safe now. The king thanked them to arrest the suspect and the magical creatures were enjoying the party again</p>


<p>Sherlock was not 100% sure if she was the suspect. 
But it's time to go home.</p>
