            <p>The big footprints lead to the dinosaur's nest. They searched around what was in the nest and found two eggs which were three times higher than their height. </p>
<p>Sherlock: "I still can't believe what I am seeing now...so dinosaur really exist!? It's impossible!!!"
BAM! BAM! BAM! The dinosaur kid showed up in front of them. He was staring at them as if waiting for the chance to eat them. They slowly moved their one foot backward...and started to run!!!
But the dinosaur kid runs faster than them, it was getting closer!! We are gonna be eaten by them!!! There is no time to think.
