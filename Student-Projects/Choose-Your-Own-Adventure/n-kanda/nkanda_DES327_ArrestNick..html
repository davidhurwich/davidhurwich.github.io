            <p>Sherlock arrested Nick.</p>
            <p>Nick: "Why are you arresting me, Sherlock!?"</p>
            <p>Sherlock: "Because you are the one who killed the man by manipulating magical creature"</p>
            <p>Nick: "What?"</p>
<p>Sherlock: "I was thinking you were the suspect from the beginning. When we found you, numerous large footprints were everywhere. Human tend not to go to the place which feels dangerous but you did. And when the king started to talk about the truth, you need to be sure how much he remembers about the crime scene. And you decided to kill him before he says something disadvantage to you." </p>

<p>Nick: "Wait! Wait!!... Okay, I confess. I did it. The man, he was my old friend but he was threatened to resign from the CEO. He found that I was transferring some company's money to my bank. He was the only one who knew this secret, so I decided to kill him."</p>
            <p>Sherlock: "Why did you use magical creatures to kill him?"</p>
<p>Nick: "Because nobody won't know about their existence! I read about the magical studd when I was young. One day, I was lost in the magical world and I found Ms. Westfield's house. I saw and read her experiment. I steal one of her prototype just for curiosity."</p>
            <p>Sherlock: "And you realized you can use it to kill your friend."</p>
<p>Nick: "Yeah, don't you think I'm a genius? Nobody came up with this idea before hahaha. I chanted the magical spell to manipulate the phoenix, take him to the human world, and I ordered to attack my friends. Leaving a red feather was a deplorable mistake".</p>
