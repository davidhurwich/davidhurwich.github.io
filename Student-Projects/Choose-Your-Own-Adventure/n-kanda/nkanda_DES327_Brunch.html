            <p>Sherlock: "Why don't we go out and get some food instead of going crime scene today? I don't feel like going to solve some mystery today?"</p>
<p>Watson: "Oh again? What's wrong with you!? You are the one who always wants to go to the crime scene and sense it. Well, I guess Sherlock Holmes is a human, too. Fine. let's go out to get some food. I found a nice place to have brunch. It's 5 blocks away from here. Not that far."</p>

            <p>They wore a leather coat and a hat which is his symbol, locked the door and headed to the place. When they were walking down the street, one old lady who was carrying a large boston bag bump into Sherlock accidentally.</p></div>
