        <p>
            You get to two small paths. Path ‘A’ leads to a patch, Path ‘B’ leads to a cave area.</p>


        <p> The patch seems to under direct light with an abundance of flowers, while the cave seems to not have much direct light going in and has a lot of moss around it. Which one do you go to? </p>
