            You reach for the flowers to gather them, but a few seconds later, you get a burning and itching sensation on your hands. That is when you realize not only did you pick up the wrong flower, you picked up the Itchy flower, that looks similar to the Healing flower. </p>
        <p>
            You get transported back to the kingdom so that the wizard heals you itch, and nags you about how you need listen and remember about the tips that he gave you at the beginningÂ of the mission.
