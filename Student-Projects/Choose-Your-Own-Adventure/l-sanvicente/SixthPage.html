        You choose the lake, to go see if there really is a Nymph at the lake. The wizards’ spell activates to deter you from going, by inflicting some kind of pain. But it’s too late, the voice of the nymph has in traced you. You end up walking towards the center of the lake but never getting to the Nymph.
