        <p>
            You are a knight sent on an important assignment to find the healing flower in the nearby forest. A golden, 7 petal flower, said to be found in cold places where the light does not hit it directly. It is said that if you find glowing moss, then you are close to finding this flower.</p>
        <p>
            Since this a mission of high importance, as this flower may be the missing ingredient that can help accelerates the major wounds that knights and soldiers may get in battle. The wizard that assigned you this mission, put aÂ neutral spell on you, it can either help you or punish you, no pressure. Pretty harsh in my option, but it will give you the push to think things through on this mission.</p>

        <p> Now before you are 3 paths:</p>

        <p>
            The left path, it is not in the direction of the forest, so do not test the wizards spell.

            The center path that takes you to the river with the bridge, the shorter route to the forest.

            The right that take you to the forest as well but is a longer route and need more precaution when walking through it.
