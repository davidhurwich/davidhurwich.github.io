                    You have walked for hours and hours on the beach, and when it ended you have followed the path that follows a river. You quench your thirst with ice-cold water and follow the river upstream. You finally arrive at a waterfall that is 100 ft tall and the sound of the water can be heard from miles away. It is the most amazing thing you have seen in your life.</p>
                <p>
                    You are a bit exhausted from all of the walking and the deadly sun. You wonder whether you can climb to the top of the waterfall without any equipment. Or you can just enjoy the water for a while and rest.
