                    You follow the path down into the depts of the jungle. It is getting dark and you start to wonder whether you will die in the jungle alone. For a couple of hours nothing but trees and birds. You then start smelling the ocean again. The path leads to a cliff, where you see a beach down and your ship -or whatever remains of your ship- is there. You also can make the outline of the mainland from up here. You go down to the beach to check the shipwreck.
                    You check the wreck for any food and items. You found a raft that seems to be less damaged. You decide to repair it and sail for the mainland.

                    After many days at sea, you arrive at the mainland. You are safe now.
