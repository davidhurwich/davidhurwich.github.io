                <p> The year is 1969, man has just landed on the Moon. You are taking a cruise to Caribbeans. It is a wonderful day, the sun is shining, the ocean is calm and you have enjoyed the company of humpback whales, while you were having your breakfast. Suddenly, the weather starts to change and dark clouds are approaching fast. The next ten hours you spend in your quarters because of the thunderstorm outside. The waves keep crashing and the ship is cracking. You are not sure how long this will continue or whether you will all be drawn. </p>

                <p> You open your eyes with sand and salty water in your mouth. You are laying down on a beach somewhere. You slowly get up and look around. There is no one around you and all you see is the pristine beach that you have washed upon, some banana trees and very dense jungle. You feel so tired and hungry and thirsty, and all you can think about is to survive and find a way out. </p>


                <p> You continue to the banana trees and pick a bunch to have a feast. You even take a couple with you in case you need them later. There seems to be a narrow path going east and the beach extends further north.
