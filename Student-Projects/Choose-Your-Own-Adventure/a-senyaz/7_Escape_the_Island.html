                    You followed the path for an hour through various turns and end up in a clearing. Looking closely, you see some smoke down the path. You want to investigate further.</p>

                    There is a hut made up of bamboo sticks and dry leaves. There is a small fire burning, and a rabbit is being cooked. It smells like heaven.
