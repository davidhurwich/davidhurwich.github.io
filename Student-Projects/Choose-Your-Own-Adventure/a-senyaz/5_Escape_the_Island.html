                    You have been climbing for a while now. Each step is getting harder and harder... </p>

                <p>
                    Then you hear a familiar noise. Can it be?
                </p>

                <p>
                    You start running towards the top, barely containing your excitement. Yes, you can see it now, it is a plane circling around. Maybe they are looking for survivors. You start waving your arms and jumping up and down. The pilot sees you in the opening up top, and signals back by doing a sortie. </p>

                <p> You are saved now.

                </p>
