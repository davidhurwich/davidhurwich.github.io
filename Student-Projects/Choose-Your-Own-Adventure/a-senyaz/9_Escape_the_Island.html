                    You slowly reach out to your pocket and take out the bananas. You offer them with a big gesture to the man in the hopes that he does not kill you.
                    He seems to like the friendly offer, and his tonne changes. He starts talking and talking and talking. You don't understand a word. Then, he offers you his bow and arrows and points you to the path down south that goes deep into the jungle. He makes gestures that may indicate danger, beach or both. You decide to take the bow and continue on your journey.

                <p>
                    You follow the path through the dense jungle. It is getting darker and colder. As you continue down, you start to feel like somebody is watching you. You are more alert and start to constantly look around, tired and afraid.
                    You see two eyes popping up in the dark. You know what they are. It is a Jaguar staring at you from the top of a branch! Frozen, you try to think about how you can get out alive.
