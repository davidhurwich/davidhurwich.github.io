                    You go into the ice-cold water and just enjoy the view and forget about your surroundings for a while. You even think about setting down here and make a new living. You want to go near the fall just to get a better view where you realize that there is a cave with some light coming in at the bottom of the waterfall. You decide that it is worth checking whether it leads anywhere.

                    You arrive at the bottom of a pretty steep hill. It seems like a pretty strenuous climb up there, but it may be worth having a better look at the island from above. There is also a path into the jungle down south. It may also be worth looking there for more food.
