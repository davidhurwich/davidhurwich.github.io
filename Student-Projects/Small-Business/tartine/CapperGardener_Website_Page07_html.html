                <h2> KID BREAD </h2>
                <h2> $11.25</h2>

                <p>

                    These breads are every bit of amazing, doughy goodness as our other breads. The only difference is their size. This means that our kid's breads are made with the same amazing ingredients, and baked thoughtfully and with lots of love, but are ready to grab and go. Our kid's breads make the perfect bread basket at your dinner parties, and are great if you're heading out to a picnic in the park and done need a whole loaf. We've noticed, that because they're so small, the absorb heat faster, often making their crunch extra amazing!
