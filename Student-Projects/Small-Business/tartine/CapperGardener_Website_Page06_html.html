                <h2> $11.25</h2>

                <p>

                    This bread is for those moments when you still want bread, but maybe have had a little too much bread. This is that whole wheat bread that everyone is a little skeptical about. But our whole wheat bread is different. Wheat is taking care of from before it's planted. Our watering, harvesting, and baking process is focused entirely on infusing our ingredients with more flavor. So when you take a bite of our whole wheat seeded loaf, yes, you're getting whole wheat. But, you're getting a whole lot of delicious flavors along with it.
