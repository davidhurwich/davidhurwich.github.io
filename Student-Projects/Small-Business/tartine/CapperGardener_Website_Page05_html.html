                    This bread is, you guessed it, made from oats from the same, trusted farmers that we source our wheat and seeds from! This bread recipe was inspired by and old family recipe, passed on through generations. The oats are ground up, and mixed into the dough, as well as left whole to add a nice little crunch. To us, this dough feels like the perfect breakfast bread. Spread some jam on it, or butter and brown sugar! It takes like home and good memories and had just enough of a crunch to keep you wanting more!
