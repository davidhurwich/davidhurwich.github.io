                <p>
                    This bread is made, with love, from rye and seeds, which, as always, are grown and farmed with farmers that we work closely with. This bread is kneaded for four hours, before being allowed to rise in a cool stone chamber, surrounded by a variety of nuts and seeds, to contribute to the flavor. From there, the bread is baked slowly, so that it comes out just a little softer than normal. We do this, because our sprouted, seeded rye, makes amazing toast. We want to ensure that this toasting process on your end, is the final step in the baking!
