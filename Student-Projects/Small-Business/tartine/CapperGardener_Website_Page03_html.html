                <h2> COUNTRY LOAF</h2>
                <h2> $11.25</h2>

                <p>
                    This country loaf is inspired by good old-fashioned country bread. This bread is made from wheat grown from farmers we know, love, and trust. From there, it is kneaded in a slow kneed process, for two days. The kneading process takes place in a room where rosemary and firewood is burning, allowing the dough to soak up this delicious flavors, even before being baked. From there, the bread is baked in our hand-made, one of a kind stone bread over, designed specifically to get that perfect crunch on the outside, and the soft, warm chew on the inside.
