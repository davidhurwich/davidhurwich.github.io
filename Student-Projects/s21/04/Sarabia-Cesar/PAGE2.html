<h1>Coffee From Where?</h1>

<p>Wake up! You are going to be late for school! Most importantly you are going to miss the bus! You know this commute to SFSU hurts and if you don't wake up what will end up hurting are those grades due to attendance harming your GPA! Well now that you're up you need to decide where to get your coffee. Do you think you can make coffee at home or make a quick run to Starbucks?</p>
