<h1>Phone Call?</h1>

<p>What you thought was possibly a phone call ended up being the alarm you hit snooze on. As you tried to multitask by checking your phone and making it to the bus stop, you didn't notice the dent on the sidewalk. This dent caused you to trip and crack your phone screen. Not only did you crack your phone screen but also, you broke your ankle. You ended up crying until you died from dehydration.</p>
