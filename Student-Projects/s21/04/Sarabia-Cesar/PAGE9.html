<h1>LEFT</h1>

<p>So you trusted your gut and went left. As you turned to the left, you didn't realize that there was an open sewer pothole. You fell for many miles until you ended up in a wonderland filled with talking animals and an evil queen. Although you lived life like Alice, you didn't manage to make it to the bus stop.</p>
