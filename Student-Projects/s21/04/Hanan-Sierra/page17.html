        <p> You hand the goblet to your father, and he takes a weak sip from it, then some more, and finally downs the whole thing. He cringes at the foul taste, but suddenly sits up in bed, feelign his pains go away.</p>

        <p> You jump at him and give him a hug, accidentally turning into a butterfly, and he does the same. The two of you flutter outside and land in your front garden, enjoying a reunion picnic together. </p>
