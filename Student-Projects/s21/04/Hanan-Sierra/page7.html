        <p>You arrive at the next ingredient location, a butcher shop. You browse up and down the aisles for a CENTAUR EYE, but can't find one anywhere. The butcher in charge of the store, a tall, muscular goblin eyes you down suspiciously as he cleans his meat cleaver. A nervous lump forms in your throat as you walk up to him.</p>
        
        <p>He snorts. <em>"I see you're lookin for somethin' rarer. Well we keep all the rare meat in the back. Y'know, elf ears, centaur eyes..."</em> He glances at the front door, then at you again. <em>"...Shapeshifter blood. Now that goes for a pretty penny. You wouldn't happen to know where I could find some, would you?" 
        </em></p>
