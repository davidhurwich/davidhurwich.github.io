        <p>You arrive at the local flower shop to get your next ingredient. You look for the bucket of MOONDROP FLOWERS, but can't seem to find it, until you see an elderly elf walking around the store, who you presume to be the head florist based on his green apron. </p>
        <p>Before you walk up to ask him about the flowers, you notice a perfectly-kept bundle of MOONDROP FLOWERS just beside him, with a price tag reading "<strong>MOONDROP FLOWERS: just 80 COINS per BUNDLE</strong>". You look into your gold pouch and count only 6 coins inside. The elderly elf begins to turn his back to the flowers. What do you do?</p>
