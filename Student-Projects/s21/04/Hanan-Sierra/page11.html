        <p>You decide that you're running out of time and need those flowers NOW, no matter the cost. </p>
        <p>When the florist's back is turned, you dash past him, grab a bundle, and sprint towards the front door. However, just as you're about to run out with them, you feel your whole body tumble downwards and land on the ground with a bang. You look up to see the florist hunched over, with his leg out. He tripped you.</p>
        <p><em> "Ah ah ah. Thought you could get away with that one, didn't you? Heh heh. Though..."</em> He looks into your eyes with curiosity. </p>
