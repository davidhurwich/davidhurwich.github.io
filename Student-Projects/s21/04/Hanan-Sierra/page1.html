        <p>You are a shapeshifter-human hybrid who is learning to be able to shapeshift like your father, a prominent doctor who also happens to be a shapeshifter. Unfortunately, you can only currently turn into a glowing blue butterfly. One day, as you are working on your shapeshifting technique, your father suddenly falls ill.</p>
        <p>You hear him call out to you. He wants to talk.
