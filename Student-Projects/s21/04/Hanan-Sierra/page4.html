        <p>You figure  it would be too dangerous to turn into your butterfly form, and would take far too long.</p>
            
        <p>You grab your trusty horse Epona outside and climb up on her saddle. You head off to the nearest ingredient location, an abandoned sacred fountain. As you arrive,you begin to look around for a cup of some sort floating in the glowing pool of water, when suddenly a giant fairy comes splashing out of the water! She holds out her hand and says three words to you:</p>
        <p><em>"I will give you what you seek. But, I request an equivalent offering in return."</em></p>
