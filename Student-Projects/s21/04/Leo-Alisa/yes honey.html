                    Melissa was so excited to be invited to one of her favorite Youtubers place. She was such a huge fan. Melissa did not know if she was more excited to see where HoneySoSweet lives or if she was more excited to hear Honey's secret for staying so thin.

                    When Melissa got to Honey's place, Honey instantly got each one of them some tea and started to spill her secrets to what her weight loss secret was. Melissa was so suprised to hear what it was, It was nothing that she was expecting. Melissa thought Honey was a health nut and that her weight loss secret had involved a lot of working out. To Melissa's suprise, her secret was a special beef jerky that was infused with all natural herbs to speed up the metabolism in order to have rapid weight loss.

                    Honey offers Melissa a few servings of the beef jerky, without hesitation Melissa pockets the beef jerky into her purse.
