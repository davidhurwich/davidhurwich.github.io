                    Melissa goes on to Youtube and starts to watch Mukbangs (Korean Eating Shows)
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    She likes to watch these shows becuase she likes to visualize herslef eating the same foods as the mukbangers are eating. In hopes to try and supress her cravings and hunger for those foods.
