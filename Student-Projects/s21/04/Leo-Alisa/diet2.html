                    Melissa decided to go on the world wide web and research some diet pills and supplements she can take for rapid results in weight loss. She hates to work out so she wants to find an easy way out of working out by taking diet pills.

                    <br>
                   Melissa found many pills and supplements known to supress hunger creating less of an appetite to control her eating habits. She was skeptical of the claims that the product was stating but she wanted to give anything a try to avoid the idea of having to physically work out. This option seems more up Melissa's alley as it did not ask for a lot of physical work from her.

                    She reserached one diet pil after the other and before Melissa knew it, her shift at work was coming to an end.
