                    Melissa has always struggled with her weight since she was very young. She has recently turned 25 years old and has been on a strict diet for as long as she could remember. However, her temptation to eat greasy foods with lots of carbs has always been her weakness. She has fallen back on her weight loss journey and is starting to get very desperate with her journey.

                    Melissa has been working all day at her corporate office and is ready to go for a break. She always likes to go on her breaks with her friend Nancy.

                    Nancy, "how has your weight loss journey been going?"
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Melissa, "It hasn't been going as well as I hoped, I ate half of a double cheese pizza yesterday. I just could not take another day of just salads again!"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Melissa, "Nancy you should join me on my weight loss journey, I could use the motivation!"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Nancy, "Sorry Melissa but I love food way too much to be giving it up.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As their break was about to end someone decided to walk towards them. It was their boss, "Come on fatties, time to get back to work!"
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As Melissa got back to her desk after her break she realized she finished all her tasks for today. She still had about more hours to her shift.

                    What should Melissa do for the rest of her shift?
