                    Melissa hates working out but she decided to go on Youtube and watch some of the workout routines for rapid weight loss. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Melissa realizes she never does the workouts herself once she has the time. She does not liek the feeling of sweat and usually tries to avoid doing any unnecessary physical activity. She watches these videos as more of a way to gain motivation within herself because she loves to see the before and afetrs of the people who do the workouts. It gives her hope that one day she can achieve that same figure as well.

                    She watches these videos one after the other and before Melissa knew it, her shift at work was coming to an end.
