                    Time flew by so quickly at work after trying to pass the time on the internet. Melissa decides to get ready to pack up her things and leave the office.

                    Melissa reaches the train station to catch the train back to her apartment building. As she was walking through the crowds of people to get to her train stop... A skinny, long legged, and very pretty lady walked past her. She noticed it was one of her favorite Korean Mukbang Youtuber, it was HoneySoSweet! Melissa was so excited to have spotted her that she chased after Honey to try and speak to her.

                    Melissa asked Honey How she remained so skinny while eating so much for her shows. Honey did not want to reveal her secret so out in the open in such a public area. Honey asked Melissa if she would like to go to her place for some tea and chat about her secrets.

                    <br>
                    Should Melissa go with HoneySoSweet?
