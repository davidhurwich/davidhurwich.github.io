    <h1>Golden Island</h1>
     
     <h3>When you step on the Island, a voice comes out.</h3>

<p>XXX: "Hey Stranger!!!
How's your trip here? Don't be afraid if you cannot see me. I am in your mind. I won't hurt you. Maybe I will help you at some point."

The voice is gone. You start to look around the Island. Which way are you choosing to go? 
     </p>
