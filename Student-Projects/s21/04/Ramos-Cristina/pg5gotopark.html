        <p> You go to the neighboring park and see skippys leash. You're getting one step closer to finding him. You remember that Skippyâ€™s favorite street food vendor is pretty close by. He could be over there eating a snack. You're also pretty close to the dog store and skippy loves going there to play with the dog toys.
