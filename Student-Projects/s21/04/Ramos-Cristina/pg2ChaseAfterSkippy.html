            <h2> Chase After Skippy </h2> </header>
        <p> You chase after him but it dooes no good, he was way too fast. You cannot figure out if he went left or right. There is no trace of him. You start to panic. You don't want Skippy to get lost or even worse for him to get injured. You have to do something quick. </p>
        <p> You start to think that maybe he ran down to the neighboring park. You also think that maybe he ran back home.</p>
        <p> What do you do?</p>
