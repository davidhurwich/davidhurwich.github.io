        <p> You test your luck again and go to the pet store. Before walking in you cross your fingers, its getting late and you dont want Skippy to spend the night in the street. You walk in and ask the cashier if she has seen skippy, she said he just left.</p>
        
        <p> That means he must be having a snack at the streetfood vendor!</p> </main>
