        <p> You test your luck again and go to the pet store. Before walking in you cross your fingers, its getting late and you dont want Skippy to spend the night in the street. Just as you're about to walk through the doors Skippy is walking out. He is so happy to see you!</p>
            
        <p> Yay! You found Skippy! </p>
