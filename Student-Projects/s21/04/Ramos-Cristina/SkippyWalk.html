        <p> It's a beautiful sunny day in New York City, you and your dog best friend Skippy are going for your daily stroll in the park. You're happy and it seems like today will be the perfect day. You notice that something grabed skippyâ€™s attention. He is fixated on a squirrel. You try to nudge him along but he is not moving. All of a sudden the squirrel runs in front of Skippy and he runs after it! You lose control of skippy and accidentally let go of his leash.
            
        <p> You can either chase after him or call out his name and hope he listens and comes back to you. </p>
        
        <p> What do you do? </p>
