        <p> You walk over to the streetfood vendor and hope Skippy is there. But just your luck he is not! 
            <p> You talk to the owner: "Hey has skippy been over here? I lost him earlier today and have been looking for him all over the place." </p>
            
            <p> He answers: "Yes I just saw skippy about 30 minutes ago he just finished some puppy icecream and went across the street. I thought it was weird that you weren't with him." </p>
            
        <p> You are getting closer to finding skippy. You think to yourself, "well if he isn't here then he must be at the pet store." </p>
