Complaints of paranormal activity have been occurring in the neighboring town. Some of them are rather harmless and range from objects being thrown around the street to ghost sightings. Unfortunately, within the past year, missing person and missing animal reports have also increased and seem to have a connection with this. 
<br>
<br>The locals believe that the paranormal activity is attributed to an abandoned run-down hospital that was originally built in the 1600s, but has been vacant for a century. There is not much information on the history of the hospital, other than its property name: Medical Pavilion. The city has been unable to demolish the building as property is considered historical and federally protected. Those who have ventured nearby reported grotesque sightings of young hospital patients that have been inhumanely experimented on.
<br> 
<br>Some ghost hunters and exorcists have attempted to crack the case, but none have returned. It is unsure if they are dead or alive. Desperate to lift the curse, the citizens have contacted you, a professional exorcist that has yet to fail a case. 
<br>
<br>Looks like itâ€™s up to you to get to the root of the curse on this town.
