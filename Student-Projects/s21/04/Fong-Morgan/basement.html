<p>Something tells you to trust the note, as you believe it is a cry for help. Luckily, you brought matches and gasoline with you in case you had to burn anything. You find the basement and after going through a few rooms you are surprised to discover dozens of mutilated corpses preserved in formaldehyde tanks. 
<br>
<br>You start to piece together that this place is rampant with ghosts because their tortured bodies and souls were never laid to rest after all these centuries. 
<br>
<br>Will you burn the corpses as the note requests or leave while you can?</p>
