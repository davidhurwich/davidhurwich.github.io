<p>You take this as a sign to search the cabinet. You discover horrifying documents and evidence of human experimentation that took place in this hospital when it was first founded. You learn that it was a lab disguised as a hospital that took in patients for the doctors' and scientists' personal practices and experiments that tested the limits of human biology.
<br>
<br>How were these files never discovered? Perhaps no one ever trusted this harmless ghost in the first place.
<br>
<br>A piece of paper falls out of a stack of papers you grabbed and reads,
<br>
    <br><em>“Burn the corpses, lift the curse.”</em>
<br>
<br>Behind it is a map on where to find the supposed corpses in the basement. Do you follow this ominous note or continue on your way?
