You proceed to enter the hospital building, determined to bring peace to this town. You take a gander at your surroundings and are met with dust, spider webs, dried blood, various medical supplies, and torn up and broken furniture sprawled around when you enter the lobby.
<br>
<br>An immense aura of dread and anxiety gloom over you as you step in, as the intruder who is unwelcomed. You recognize that many spirits are uneasy and suffering, unable to rest out of resentment and spite.
<br>
<br>You hear a distant scream. You hesitate, as you were told there were no life forms in this building.
You turn around and a small boy appears before you. Upon closer inspection, they are translucent and definitely a ghost. 
<br>
<br>It seems like it wants you to follow it.
