<p>In an attempt to lift the curse on the town, you set the bodies up to burn and start a fire. After the fire subsides, you feel relief. You no longer feel the dread that loomed over you when you first entered the building. On your way out, the building feels peaceful and silent of any paranormal activity. <br>
<br>You believe your job is done after an exhausting 24 hours.
A few days later, the missing people returned to their families and homes. Your fellow ghost hunter colleagues who previously failed this mission also reappeared after having gone missing for months. They have no recollection of where they were before, and only recall seeing visions of ghosts and hospital patients before their disappearance. 
<br>
<br>This phenomenon has yet to be explained, but you feel relieved that you lifted the curse and could allow the victims of the Medical Pavilion to finally rest.</p>
    
    <p> <em>Congratulations!</em> You lifted the curse.</p>
