<p> You ignore the ghost, thinking itâ€™s nothing of significance. Instead, you focus on exploring the building and finding any clues. 
<br>
<br>You learn that the hospital is relatively small, being two stories tall, but has numerous patient and operating rooms as well as an underground basement.
In the midst of exploring, you are met with a hostile-looking ghost. It looks like a human hospital patient, but is mutilated and grotesque looking to the point of being animalistic. You can sense danger and feel threatened. 
<br>
<br>Do you approach it or run?
