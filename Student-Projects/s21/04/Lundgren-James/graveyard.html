                <p>You emerge from the tunnel and realize you're now out in the graveyard. You hide behind a nearby tombstone. In the distance, you see two gates. One of them may lead you to freedom. The East Gate has an emblem on it in the shape of a boat sail. The West Gate has an emblem of swords and shields.
