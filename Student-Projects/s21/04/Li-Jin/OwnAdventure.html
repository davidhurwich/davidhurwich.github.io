<p>When you wake up, you are lying in the sunny grass. The sky is light purple with golden clouds. There are many colorful tiny diamonds hanging in the sky. Many small rainbows of different shapes are floating in the sky. Little flowers and trees that have never been seen but are beautiful. You landed on a small island in the sky is also a world full of fantasy. 

While you are enjoying the scenery, a talking fox appears in front of you and asks you to choose a bracelet. He said that the bracelet cannot be removed after it is worn and decides what kind of life you live on this island. One is made of green bracelets that always keep fresh, with the smell of plants and trees, and a few butterflies around it. The other is a brown bracelet made of small diamonds that change color every few seconds and soft leather.</p><br>
