<p>After putting on the green bracelet, directions appeared on the ground for you to walk. There are many birds, bunnies, and kittens are surrounding you and following you. Suddenly a wolf appears. He grabbed the two rbunnies following you and said, he wants the bracelet you wear, otherwise he will kill these two rabbits. 

Although you can't take off your bracelet by yourself, the animals and creatures living on the island here can take your bracelet with your consent.</p>
