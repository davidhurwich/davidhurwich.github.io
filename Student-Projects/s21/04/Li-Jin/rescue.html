<p>(This is just the little bunnie to test whether you are an animal-loving person) When you pick up the little bunnies to see if they are injured, your wrists gradually glow, and the bracelet you gave to the wolf appeared. Suddenly two mechanical servants and a carriage made of crystal appear to greet you. One of them said to you, "Your Majesty, we will pick you up to the palace.

At the same time, the birds, the little bunnies and the kittens ask you not to go with the servants and see if you can live with them. </p><br>
