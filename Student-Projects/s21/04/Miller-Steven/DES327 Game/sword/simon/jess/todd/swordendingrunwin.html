You decide to bolt out of the cave faster than you came in… that is until you realize that the ghoul tailing you isn’t bound by the limitations of human speed. You realize that it’ll catch up to you in no time and begin to regret your decision to ever come in.<br><br>
                    
Fortunately, you had Simon by your side. He immediately triggers a smoke bomb allowing you to vanish from sight. You retreat to cover to form a plan for a cooperative attack.
