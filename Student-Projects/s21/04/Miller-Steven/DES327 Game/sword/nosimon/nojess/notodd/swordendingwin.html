The beast stops for a moment and speaks to you. “Wait we don’t need to fight! I’m sorry, I was startled by you breaking into my home! But I’m not actually all that bad. It’s just that usually when adventurers like you arrive they’re looking for a fight…”<br><br>

You stop and consider what they just said… maybe they can be a new ally? It’s like the old cliche: the power of friendship prevails all. <br><br>

You introduce yourself, and they do too, and you come to realize that appearances can be quite deceiving. With a new ally, it seems your adventure is coming to a satisfying end. Congratulations on a successful journey!
