You decide to approach the assassin and introduce yourself. Without looking you directly in the eye, he does the same.<br><br>

“I’m Simon, I’m a ninja from the Inner Circle, although I guess these days I would consider myself more freelance. I’m surprised you didn’t attack me, not everyone out here in the woods is so kind. What brings you to these parts?”<br><br>

You explain to him that you are on a journey.<br><br>

“A journey? That’s not very specific… but I guess it’s more specific than wandering around the woods. Mind if I join you?”<br><br>

Simon has joined your party!
