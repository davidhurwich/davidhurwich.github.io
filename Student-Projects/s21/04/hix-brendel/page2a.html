<h1>Making It To The Date</h1>
    <img src="car1.jpeg">
    <P>
  Jimmy is working on his job... which is tricking people into schemes that leads them into FRAUD. Jimmy already seems like bad news. I mean unless you're into that kind of "bad boy" type of guy, no judgements here.
    Jimmy has only stolen 7 cars and his daily estimate is 10 cars. His date is in 2 hours and is across town in Downtown Chicago, he still wants to pick up flowers and shower and change. Will he make it?</P>

    <P2>
        Jimmy has two options:
        1) Jimmy could take on one car and pay for helpers to steal the other two which doesn't give him as much money to pay for the dinner, but allows him to have two hours to run home and freshen up and pick up some flowers. Or... 
        2) Jimmy could take all 3 cars and try to finsih them in 45 minutes-an hour and skip his shower and flowers and make it across town. But he'll still have enough money for appetizers and dessert to make up for it.
