<h1>Making It To The Date-Menus</h1>
    <img src="wine.jpeg">
    <P>
Jimmy has decided to keep calm and try to blend in with the crowd. He does so by placing his menu infront of his face. Fiona tells him that he looks funny, and shes asking him why he's acting so strange. Jimmy makes up a story that one of his crazy exes are at the restaurant and that he doesn't want her to see him. Fiona kind of accepts Jimmy's weirdness and plays the part with him. Out of Jimmy's side eye he sees that the cop is arresting a guy who usually dines and dashes at that Nobu every Friday night. Lucky Jimmy the cop doesn't recognize him!  </P>

     The night continues and Jimmy and Fiona has a wonderful date which leads to their first kiss!
