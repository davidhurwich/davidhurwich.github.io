<h1>Making It To The Date-The Kitchen</h1>

    <P>
      Jimmy told Fiona, "I will explain everything later but we need to leave NOW!" Strangely... Fiona is up for the challenge and is all game! Jimmy and Fiona escape through the kitchen back, the employees are yelling at them that they "Can't be back here!" but they safely escape. Jimmy already called a getaway car and they're able to escape. Fiona surpsingly didn't ask any questions she was excited to be apart of some bad ass scheme!
