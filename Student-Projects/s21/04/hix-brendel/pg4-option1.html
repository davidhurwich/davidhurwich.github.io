<h1>Making It To The Date-Jimmy's Decisions</h1>

    <P>
      Now Jimmy is flying through cars, he has side swiped a couple of cars in the time being! Way to go Jimmy... If he is caught he has some big bucks or time to pay. Now how would Fiona like that? As Jimmy is sliding down the steets of Chicago he finally is able to escape the cop as he crosses another car identical to the one he is driving. The cops end up pulling the identical car over and Jimmy is in the clear. Jimmy returns the car to his work and he is now able to run down to the the flower shhop on his way home. Jimmy picks up some red roses and then he returns home to freshen up. He finally makes it on time to Nobu and meets up with Fiona. She loves the flowers!! But during the middle of dinner he spots the same cop that was chasing him earlier. Jimmy is now in a panic! What should he do next?
</P>

    <P2>
        1) Tell Fiona that he is in big trouble with the cops and they need to make a run for it? 
        2) Keep calm and try to blend in with the crowd.
