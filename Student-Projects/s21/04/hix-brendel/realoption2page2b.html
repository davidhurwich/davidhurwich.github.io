        <h1>Making It To The Date-Follow Carh1</h1>
    <img src="cop.jpeg">
    <P>
Jimmy has decided to call up his follow car that usually follows him for any situations like this one. As Jimmy is "scrambling" to find his license and registration a minute later (thank the heavens) an occasional child kidnapping happened on the same corner as Jimmy and the cop was at! What a crazy coincidence. The cop sees all of this happening and completely forgets about Jimmy and starts to call back up, he hops in his police car and chases after the "kidnapper". This sets Jimmy free! Go Jimmy! Jimmy then proceeds to goes on to head home after his car run and pick up some beautiful roses for Fiona, he then goes home to shower and freshens up and he is able to make it to Nobu on time. But then... Jimmy spots the cop from earlier that pulled him over. Now Jimmy starts to panic... Should he? </P>

       1) Tell Fiona that he is in big trouble with the cops and they need to make a run for it? 
        2) Keep calm and try to blend in with the crowd.
