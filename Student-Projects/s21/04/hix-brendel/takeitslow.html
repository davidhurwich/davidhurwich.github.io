<h1>Making It To The Date-Taking It Slow</h1>

    <P>
Jimmy offers Fiona a nice romantic walk through the city of Chicago. As they walk they talk about their hopes, ambitions, and dreams. Eventually when Jimmy tries to land for a kiss a sketchy van pulls up and covers their heads with sacks and swipes Jimmy off the street. It's his sketchy job, they need him to steal more cars or else he's dead. Fiona is super freaked out by this and she never talks to Jimmy again! </P>

 THE END!
