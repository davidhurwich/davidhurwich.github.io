<h1>Making It To The Date</h1>

    <P>
    Jimmy has had his eye on Fiona for awhile now. He finally got the courage to ask her on a date. At first, she blows him off since she has a lot going on in her life but after a few times of encouraging her, Fiona says yes. She tells him that he better not be like all the other guys in Chicago and blow her off or mess up in any way. He promises that he won't and that it will be the best date she has ever been on. She's still skeptical but they set up a date for the next night. Jimmy has a big day planned ahead, do you think you can help Jimmy get through the obstacles he needs to get through in order to make it on time for the date? If so you are up for a challenge!
