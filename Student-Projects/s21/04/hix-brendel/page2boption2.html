<h1>Making It To The Date-Cars</h1>
    <img src="car1.jpeg">
    <P>
Jimmy has decided to take all three cars. Is it a crazy idea? Maybe, but at least he'll have enough money for the magical date with Fiona. As Jimmy is on his third car run he is speeding a little too fast going 100 mph throughout Downtown. He glances at his rearview mirrors and he sees red and blue lights flash in the reflection. Jimmy decides to pull over and the officer knocks on his window and says "license and registration". Jimmy has neither... Should he?</P>

    <P2>
       1) Should Jimmy make a run for it and go on a high speed chase or...
        2) Call up back up to distract the cop by creating a scene...
