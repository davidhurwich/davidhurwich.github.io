        <p>You make it to the waterfall.  You can hear the monster trailing behind you.  You keep running until you approach a maze.  You enter the maze and try to find your way through.  After a couple minutes you feel like giving up.  You felt like you tried all the different ways to get out and find the end, but you cant.  You're stuck in the maze.<br>
