            <p>“Hey Tenshi, what’s up?” “Hi, Hana what are you doing home?” “I came to visit for the weekend. On my way into town, I saw Usagi and gave her a ride.” “Ten-nii you’re acting kind of weird, especially these last couple of days. Are the spirits messing with you even more lately?” Damn it’s like Usagi knows what’s going. I forget these two have a good sixth sense too. “So, is everything alright Tenshi??”
