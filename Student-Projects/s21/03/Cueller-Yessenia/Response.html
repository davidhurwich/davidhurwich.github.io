Why do you keep following me?” “My name is Ami, I would tell you my last name, but I don’t remember it, in fact I don’t remember much about anything. I don’t even remember how I got like this. Sorry to have kept following you, but I couldn’t help but notice that you’re different! You knew that I was around! Please can you help find my family! I need to know what happened to them and what happened to me. Will you please?”
