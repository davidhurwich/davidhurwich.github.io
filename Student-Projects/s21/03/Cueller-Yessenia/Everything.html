            <p>These two will catch on. If I tell them they may be of some help too. “Hana, Usagi, there is something, maybe you can help me, well I mean us. You’re partially right Usagi, it has something to do with spirits.” “Thought so, even my senses were felling kind of jammed.” “I definitely felt that as well too, as soon as I walked in with Usagi. There’s a heavy felling of hopelessness, plus I can definitely feel that it’s not just us three in this room.” “You two are right, I’m not sure if she wants to show herself to you guys just yet, but a few days ago this young girl Ami showed herself to me finally after following me around for a while. I’m trying to help her find out what happened to her and her family. Is it okay if my sisters help us too Ami?” I didn’t think she’d show herself right away, but I think Ami knows this was her chance to find peace. “Please if you could help, I’d be so grateful to you.”
