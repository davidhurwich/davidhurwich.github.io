            <p>My name is Tenshi Otonashi, I’m a 16-year-old sophomore. I’d like to say I have a pretty normal life, I go to school, study, hangout with friends, and spend time with my family. However, there is one thing in my life that is very paranormal, I can sense spirits. It’s something I’ve been able to do my whole life. I can feel spirits’ presence, I can hear them all though it’s not really clear, I mainly see shadows and lights, and sometimes even flash images of them. My sisters Hana and Usagi can sort of sense the paranormal as well, but aren’t as affected as I am. That’s another thing…recently I feel my sense has grown even stronger. It feels as though someone, or something has been following me. I wonder if I should call out to it or just ignore it..
