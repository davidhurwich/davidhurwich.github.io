    <p>You leave your room and slowly head to the living room. You see a moving figure in the dark. </p>
    <p> You turn on the lights but realize nothing is there until... </p> 
    <p>You turn around to see three kids in front of you. They are strangely faded in appearance… </p>
    <p>The girl starts talking to the two other boys, “Hey do you think she can see us?” </p>
    <p>Boy: “No way, no normal human can see us... right?” </p>
    <p>Another boy stares at you while you stare back at him. You look down to see him sticking out his hand as if he was asking for a handshake.</p>
    <p>“Hey, hey, hey, she can see us!”, he shouts in a panicked manner while shoving the other two. </p>
    <p>The girl looks straight at you and glares. “Hey, you. You can see us right?”, she asks.
