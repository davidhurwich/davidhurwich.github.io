    <p>You see more malicious ghosts than usual roaming around the city and they seem more dangerous than the ones you usually encounter.</p>
    <p>You call Tina and tell her about this. She arrives at your location and looks around.</p>
    <p>“Where are these coming from?”</p>
    <p>“This seems to be the area where they are gathering around and we don’t know why”, Ken says.</p>
    <p>“Danger”, Ben randomly says.</p>
    <p>A familiar cloud of smoke appears before you. Rin, Ken, and Ben back away while Tina quickly stands between you and the cloud of smoke with a serious expression.</p>
    <p>“Dust…”, Tina mumbles.</p>
    <p>“Well, hello again little friend”, Dust says happily.</p>
    <p>“Is this your doing?”, Tina asks.</p>
    <p>“Oh, if it isn’t one of the SouLs? How do you like my minions?”</p>
    <p>“Hope you like my present. I have something to do so I’ll see you around, new friend.” The smoke then dissipates.</p>
    <p>The group of malicious ghosts start attacking. Thirty minutes had passed and Tina was struggling to stand her ground.</p>
    <p>“What do we do?”, Rin says as the three siblings panic.</p>
    <p>You notice one of the malicious ghosts was going to attack Tina.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
