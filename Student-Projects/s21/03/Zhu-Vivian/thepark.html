    <p>You eat, get dressed, and head out. The three ghost siblings follow you as you head out the door.</p>
    <p>As you arrive at the park, Rin and Ben already went somewhere else on their own. You notice people that are floating around and faded just like the three siblings.</p>
    <p>“Oh them? They are ghosts too but they can’t detach themselves from that area. They must hold some regrets after they died,” Ken explains.</p>
    <p>You look at the three siblings and wonder…</p>
    <p>“What are you even doing here anyways?”, Ken asks.</p>
    <p>“To take a jog”, you reply. But by the time you reply, Ken has already headed somewhere else too.</p>
    <p>On your left, you hear a kid crying and on your right, you hear two seniors having a heated argument. For both the kid and senior, you see a ghost covered in darkness hovering over them. You should see what’s wrong.</p>
    <p>Who do you approach?</p>
