    <p>You raise your arm and jump in between Tina and the malicious ghost.</p>
    <p>“No!”, Tina shouts.</p>
    <p>A small blue light shines from your hand and the next thing you know the ghost disappears.</p>
    <p><em>What was that… ?</em></p>
    <p>You hear a group of people heading towards you. Light glows from their hands and the malicious ghosts disappear one by one.</p>
    <p>Tina sighs in relief. “You guys made it.”</p>
    <p>A tall man responds, “We got it covered, Tina. Get some rest.”</p>
    <p>You help Tina up as you watch as the SouL cleanse the malicious ghosts.</p>
