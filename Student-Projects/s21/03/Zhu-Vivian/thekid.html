    <p>You walk up to the kid over at the play structure. His worried mom is trying to calm him down but does not seem to be able to. You look at the little boy and then glance over to another kid who was with his dad and has a bunch of toys with him.</p>
    <p>You decide to head over and ask the little boy and his dad if they could share the toys with the other boy. They look over to the crying boy and nod.</p>
    <p>The little boy stops crying after the other boy gives him a toy to play with and you notice the ghost covered in darkness disappears. He also seems to have made a new friend too.</p>
    <p>You turn around to head back to your daily routine but realize that the argument between the seniors have also settled down. Someone that wasn’t there before was with the elderly. It was a girl.</p>
    <p>You continue to watch and you see a quick flash of red light that appears from her hand and the next thing you know the ghost disappears.</p>
    <p>“Those are malicious ghosts, they feed on human negativity. They can be pretty dangerous”, Rin says. The three siblings appeared out of nowhere.</p>
    <p>Ben looks up to you, points at the two little boys by the play structure, and says, “Thank you.” A bit confused but you smile and nod anyways.</p>
    <p>The girl seems to be done talking with the elderly and is heading in your direction.</p>
    <p>“Hey, I saw what you did. Good job.”, the girl says while smiling.</p>
    <p>“My name is Tina. I know you are confused but I assume these three here are your friends?”</p>
    <p>You nod hesitantly.</p>
    <p>“You saw what I did there didn’t you?”</p>
    <p>You didn't know if you should answer or not.</p>
    <p>“Let me cut straight to the point. I am a part of a group that helps cleanse those ghosts that you saw and I see that you have potential.” She hands over a business card that reads, SouL.</p>
    <p>“Will you join us?”</p>
