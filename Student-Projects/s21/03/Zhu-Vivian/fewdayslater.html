    <p>A few days passed and there were more appearances of malicious ghosts each day.</p>
    <p>Tina explains that the SouL has been struggling to cleanse all the ghosts because they kept multiplying. She asked for your help and you agreed. You knew Rin, Ken, and Ben didn’t agree with your decision but even so, they didn’t dare to stop you because they knew that the world was in danger.</p>
    <p>Tina taught you how to use your new founded powers as you two were clearing the malicious ghosts. Your powers have grown stronger drastically and may have even surpassed Tina’s powers.</p>
    <p>Eventually, the big cloud of smoke named Dust appears before you and Tina again. This time Dust has grown larger than before and you notice Rin, Ken, and Ben surrounded by dark purple smoke. They weren’t themselves…</p>
    <p>“Hey again, little friend and SouL”</p>
    <p>“What have you done to them?”, Tina shouts.</p>
    <p>“Them? These three were looking for me so I found them instead. I absorbed their soul.”</p>
    <p>“How could you, weren’t you friends before?”, you shout.</p>
    <p>“We were but like they said, we aren’t anymore.”</p>
    <p>“Why are you doing this?”, you question.</p>
    <p>“I despise this world. What more is there to say?”</p>
    <p>“Is this your petty revenge for something that happened hundreds of years ago or something?”, Tina scoffs.</p>
    <p>“No, you wouldn’t understand!”, Dust shouts in anger and a cloud of smoke starts charging towards Tina.</p>
    <p>She dodges successfully and attacks back using her powers but it does little damage to Dust.</p>
    <p>You also join in and help attack Dust while dodging some of his attacks. You realize that your special powers do have an effect on Dust compared to Tina’s powers.</p>
    <p>After a while, both sides are equally hurt and tired. Tina is on the floor and can’t seem to fight anymore. You overwhelm Dust with your powers but as you are about to deal the final blow to him, he shouts: “W-wait! If you get rid of me, you will get rid of these three!” You look at Rin, Ken, and Ben who were still surrounded in purple smoke.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
