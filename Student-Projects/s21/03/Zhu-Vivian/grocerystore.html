    <p>You eat, get dressed, and head out. The three ghost siblings follow you as you head out the door. On your way to the grocery store, you notice people that are floating around the same area and faded just like the three siblings. Even though you’ve walked on this path for your whole life, you never saw this before. </p>
    <p>“Oh them? They are ghosts too but they can’t detach themselves from that area. They must hold some regrets after they died,” Ken explains.<p>
    <p>You look at the three siblings and wonder… </p>
    <p>As you turn down a path, you see another ghost but this ghost didn’t look like the other ghosts you saw. The ghost is covered in darkness and is hovering over a person. The person looks really irritated and tired.</p> 
    <p>“Those are malicious ghosts, they feed on human negativity. They can be pretty dangerous”, Rin says.</p>
