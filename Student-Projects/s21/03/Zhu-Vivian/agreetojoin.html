    <p>You have joined the group.</p>
    <p>Tina brings you along on multiple missions to defeat these malicious ghosts, while Rin, Ken, and Ben tag along on their own accord. Most of them did not require a lot of work as they were not that powerful.</p>
    <p>During the missions, Tina explains that there are two ways to defeat these ghosts. You can either cleanse them using normal methods where the person’s negative feelings disappear but it takes longer, or you can use force to remove the ghosts like using her powers.</p>
    <p>One day, you and Tina come across another malicious ghost but this time it seemed a little more dangerous…</p>
    <p>The darkness that surrounds the malicious ghost seems to be stronger and more clouded.</p>
    <p>“Stand back, I don’t think you will be able to do much for this one.”</p>
    <p>Her hands start to glow red and the ghost disappears.</p>
    <p>“Wow!”, Ben shouts randomly.</p>
    <p>The three siblings cheer as Tina smiles and bows as a way of saying thank you. These four seem to have somehow befriended each other really quickly.</p>
    <p>When we thought the mission was finished, a cloud of smoke appeared before you. You see Rin, Ken, and Ben’s eyes widen as they back away. Tina quickly stands between you and the cloud of smoke with a serious expression.</p>
    <p>“Well, well, well. If it isn’t Rin, Ken, and Ben? What are you three doing with this human? Is this your new friend? Oh, and if it isn’t this one of the SouLs?”, the cloud of smoke speaks.</p>
    <p>“Dust…”, Tina mumbles.</p>
    <p>“Little new friend. You must be wondering who I am”, the smoke dances as if it was mocking you. “I’m also their friend.”</p>
    <p>“You’re not our friend! You’ve changed!”, Rin shouts.</p>
    <p>You glance over to see Ken glaring at the cloud of smoke while Ben was hiding behind him.</p>
    <p>The smoke grows bigger and darker.</p>
    <p>“Hmm… It’s been around 300 years since we first met haven’t it?”</p>
    <p>“I’ll see if you will even have any friends left.”</p>
    <p>The smoke separates and engulfs multiple normal ghosts around the area. You watch as they turn into malicious ghosts.</p>
    <p>“What are you doing?!”, Tina shouts.</p>
    <p>The malicious ghosts start surrounding us.</p>
    <p>“How do you like my minions?”, the large cloud of smoke says.</p>
    <p>“See you around, new friend.” The smoke then dissipates.</p>
    <p>The group of malicious ghosts start attacking. Thirty minutes had passed and Tina was struggling to stand her ground.</p>
    <p>“What do we do?”, Rin says as the three siblings panic.</p>
    <p>You notice one of the malicious ghosts was going to attack Tina.</p>
    <p>What do you do?</p>
