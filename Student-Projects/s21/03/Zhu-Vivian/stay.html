    <p>You stay in your room and lock the door.</p>
    <p>You look around for your phone until you hear something drop behind you. You slowly turn around… and see three kids looking at you, a girl and two boys. </p>
    <p>Surprised, you get up from your seat and back away.</p>
    <p>They look strangely faded in appearance.</p>
    <p>“Hey, you. You can see us right?”, the girl asks.</p>
    <p>You have nowhere to run or go.</p>
