    <p>Dust disappears with Rin, Ken, and Ben.</p>
    <p>Backup arrives and brings Tina to their hideout to treat her. Tired from the fight, you black out.</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>You wake up in an unfamiliar room.</p>
    <p>“You awake?”</p>
    <p>You look to your right to see Tina looking at you.</p>
    <p>“We both passed out at the end and Dust escaped”, she says.</p>
    <p>“What happened to Rin, Ken, and Ben?”, you ask.</p>
    <p>She doesn’t answer your question. “We will get them back”, she replies with a sad smile.</p>
    <p>You look down and think about Rin, Ken, and Ben.</p>
    <p><em>Where have they gone?</em></p>
    <p>The same tall man from before walks into the room.</p>
    <p>“Are you guys ready?”, he asks.</p>
    <p>“Ready for what?”, you ask confused.</p>
    <p>“To train, what else?”, the man smiles.</p>
