    <p>You walk up to the person and ask if they were okay. They reply and tell you that they were just having a bad day. Nothing seemed to be going their way. They thank you for asking if they were okay.</p>
    <p>The ghost that was hovering over them disappears. You split ways and head back to the three kids.</p>
    <p>“Hey, that was dangerous! Did you know that the ghost could hurt you?” Rin shouts.</p>
    <p>“What happened to the ghost?”, you ask.</p>
    <p>“The person’s negative feelings must have disappeared, so the ghost disappeared”, she says.</p>
    <p>As you are about to continue on your way to the grocery store, a girl approaches you.</p>
    <p>“Hey, I saw what you did. Good job.”, the girl says while smiling.</p>
    <p>“My name is Tina. I know you are confused but I assume these three here are your friends?”</p>
    <p>You nod hesitantly.</p>
    <p>A red light glows from her hand. “This is my power. I use this to cleanse those malicious ghosts.”</p>
    <p>“Let me cut straight to the point. I am a part of a group that helps cleanse those ghosts that you saw and I see that you have potential.” She hands over a business card that reads, SouL.</p>
    <p>“Will you join us?”</p>
