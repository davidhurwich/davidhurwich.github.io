    <p>You walk over to the bench where the seniors were arguing. They seem to be arguing about a card game.</p>
    <p>“You must have been cheating!”, the elderly man shouts.</p>
    <p>“No, I won fair and square!”, the elderly woman shouts back.</p>
    <p>The other elders watch as they argue. You step up and calm them down and suggest that they should play another game but this time with a referee. One of the other elders volunteered and the two who were arguing calmed down and apologized to each other.</p>
    <p>You notice the ghost covered in darkness disappears.</p>
    <p>You turn around to head back to your daily routine but realize that the kid you heard crying has also stopped crying. Someone that wasn’t there before was with the kid and his mom. It was a girl. You continue to watch and you see a quick flash of red light that appears from her hand and the next thing you know the ghost disappears.</p>
    <p>“Those are malicious ghosts, they feed on human negativity. They can be pretty dangerous”, Rin says. The three siblings appear out of nowhere.</p>
    <p>The girl seems to be done talking with the kid and his mom and is heading in your direction.</p>
    <p>“Hey, I saw what you did. Good job.”, the girl says while smiling.</p>
    <p>“My name is Tina. I know you are confused but I assume these three here are your friends?”</p>
    <p>You nod hesitantly.</p>
    <p>“You saw what I did there didn’t you?”</p>
    <p>You didn't know if you should answer or not.</p>
    <p>“Let me cut straight to the point. I am a part of a group that helps cleanse those ghosts that you saw and I see that you have potential.” She hands over a business card that reads, SouL.</p>
    <p>“Will you join us?”</p>
