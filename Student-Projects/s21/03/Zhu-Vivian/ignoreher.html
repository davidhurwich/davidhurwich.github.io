    <p>You head back to your room and shut the door.</p>
    <p>You shut down your computer and get into bed.</p>

    <p>“Hey! My name is Rin. These two are my younger brothers. The older one is Ken and the younger one is Ben. We're ghosts.”</p>
    <p><em>Ghosts…?</em> This was the last thing you remembered before you blacked out.</p>
