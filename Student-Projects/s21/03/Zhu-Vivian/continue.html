    <p>It is better to not get involved when you don’t know anything.</p>
    <p>As you are about to leave to continue on your way to the grocery store, you stop and see a girl approach the person. You see a quick flash of red light that appears from her hand and the next thing you know the ghost disappears. She ends her conversation with the person and starts to continue walking.</p>
    <p>However, your curiously little self couldn’t help but walk towards her.</p>
    <p>You are already standing in front of her and ask, “What was that light?”</p>
    <p>Surprised, she asks, “You saw that?”</p>
    <p>You nod.</p>
    <p>“Hmm…”, she thinks. “Can you also see them?”, she points at Rin, Ken, and Ben.</p>
    <p>“Hey! Speak to us like we are here!”, Rin shouts.</p>
    <p>You nod hesitantly.</p>
    <p>She ignores Rin and her unsure expression turns into a smile.</p>
    <p>“My name is Tina. I know this is abrupt but do you want to join our group? I am a part of a group that helps cleanse those ghosts that you saw and I see that you have potential.” She hands over a business card that reads, SouL.</p>
    <p>“Will you join us?”</p>
