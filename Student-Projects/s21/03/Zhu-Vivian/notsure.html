    <p>You are back at home. Should you have joined their group? You weren’t sure.</p>
    <p>“I have heard of their group before but I never saw them in action”, Rin says with excitement.</p>
    <p>A cloud of smoke appears before you. You see Rin, Ken, and Ben’s eyes widen as they back away.</p>
    <p>“Well, well, well. If it isn’t Rin, Ken, and Ben? What are you three doing with this human? Is this your new friend?”, the cloud of smoke speaks.</p>
    <p>“Who are you?”, you demanded.</p>
    <p>“Me? Have they not told you?”, the smoke dances as if it was mocking you. “I’m also their friend.”</p>
    <p>“You’re not our friend!”, Rin shouts.</p>
    <p>You glance over to see Ken glaring at the cloud of smoke while Ben was hiding behind him.</p>
    <p>The smoke grows bigger and darker.</p>
    <p>“Hmm… I’ll see if you will even have any friends left. It’s almost time. See you around, new friend.” The smoke then dissipates.</p>
    <p>There was a moment of silence.</p>
    <p>“Who was that?”, you ask while breathing out.</p>
    <p>“He was our friend in our past life but he changed one day… We don’t know what got to him. He started hurting people and we couldn’t stop him.”</p>
    <p>You knew this was a serious conversation but you couldn’t help but ask and you did: “... How old are you guys?”</p>
    <p>The three of them look at each other and then at me before replying: “Around 300.”
    <p><em>300 years old?!</em></p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>A few hours has passed while you were clearing your mind. The three were outside in the living room watching TV. You grab your phone and the business card that the girl had given you and start putting in the numbers.
    <p>Someone picks up: “Hello? This is Tina. Who is this?”</p>
    <p>“This is Sam, the person you wanted to recruit. I have some questions.”</p>
    <p>You explain to Tina what happened a few hours ago.</p>
    <p>“The cloud of smoke is a malicious ghost we have been trying to cleanse for some time. He doesn’t have a name but we call him Dust. Don’t try to contact him on your own. He is very dangerous as we don’t know too much about him. If he tries to do anything, call me. I’ll be over very quick”, she says with a serious tone.</p>
