            <p>After Ami showed herself, needless to say my sisters were shocked to see a full apparition. However, Hana looked more than shocked. Afterwards I talked to Hana on my own to ask what was on her mind. “When I saw Ami, I felt as if I’d seen her before, a really long time ago. I just can’t put my finger on it. If she is from this neighborhood, I might be able to ask some of my friends if they remember a girl named Ami when we were kids.” “Anything helps! Thank you, Hana!”
