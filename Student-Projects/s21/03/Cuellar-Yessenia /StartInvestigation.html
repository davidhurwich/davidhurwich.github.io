            <p>It’s kind of hard to investigate what happened to Ami or her family without knowing at least a last name. I asked Ami what she remembers, all she says she can remember was trying to find her younger brother and get him out the house in a hurry but can’t remember the reason why. Next we tried to find the area where she could have lived but she can’t pinpoint what house. It seems that she’s bounded to this neighborhood. Just as I was about to ask Ami another question my older sister Hana and younger sister Usagai came in.
