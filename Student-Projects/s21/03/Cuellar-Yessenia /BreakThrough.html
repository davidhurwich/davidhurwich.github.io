            <p> The following day Hana and Usagi bolted into my room. “Tenshi, Ami! Hana-nee has some big news!” “Ami, I knew there was a reason why you looked so familiar to me! When I was really little you used to bring your little brother Hajime to the park to play with all the rest of us younger kids. Both you and your brother are older than me, but I remembered you always being around.” “Tenshi-nii we figured out why it is that Ami became attached to you too. It was not only because of your heightened 6th sense, but you know Ami’s younger brother.” “I do?” So many thoughts and people ran through my head until I realized who it was. “Furukawa-sensi!! He’s one of the only younger adults I interact with, he’s my homeroom teacher, he just finished his student-teacher training and recently started working at my school! Ami your last name is Furukawa, and you did grow up in this neighborhood!”
