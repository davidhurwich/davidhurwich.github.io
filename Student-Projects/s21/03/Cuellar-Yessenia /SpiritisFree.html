            <p> The following Monday, I stood behind after class to talk to Furukawa-sensei about Ami, unknowing that the spirit of is older sister was next to me. “Furukawa-sensei, this may seem out of nowhere, but do you have an older sister by chance?”
 “That is out of nowhere, but yes, I had an older sister named Ami. She passed away when I was a kid, in fact she saved my life before she passed away. Why do you ask?” 
“I know this may seem crazy but for the past few weeks, I’ve been talking to your sister and trying to help her find you. She needed to make peace with her death, so that she isn’t forever bounded to this earth becoming a wandering spirit. I know this is hard to believe, but Ami is right next to m-“
Before I could finish my sentence, a white flash shined right next to me, it was so bright that even Furukawa-sensei saw it. From the light emerged Ami that was so human like, she no longer had a translucent look.  She walked over to her little brother, who was now taller, and older than she was. “I’m so happy to see you’re doing well Hajime, I’m so proud of you. I wish I could have been there to watch you grow up, just know that I always have and will love you. And Tenshi, I can’t thank you and your sisters enough for all of this. I’m truly at peace now.”
And with those last words Ami, the wandering spirit was able to finally rest.
