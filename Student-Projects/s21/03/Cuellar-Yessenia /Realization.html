            <p> “It’s all starting to come back to me. Hajime, my parents, and I lived a few houses down from this one. There was a fire, and the last thing I could remember was trying to find Hajime and get him out of the house. When we finally made it out, I just remember it going completely black, but then it felt like I woke up and have just been here in this neighborhood.” Later I researched the incident online and found an old news paper article form 1999 about a house fire that had claimed the life of 12-year-old Ami Furukawa. After the fire, the Furukawa family moved to a neighboring town, which was why Ami a spirit bounded to only the area she once lived at, couldn’t find her family.  Now that we knew Ami’s story and know a family member, we can get Ami to see her brother, and finally find some peace.
