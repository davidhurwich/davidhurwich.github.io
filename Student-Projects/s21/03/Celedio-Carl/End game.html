<p> As you are walking you start to see 2 big garage doors. Scambling around to try to open it quitely you look for some sort of a button to open. </p>

<p> After some time you finally found a lever, you pull it and once the door opens you make a run for it.</p>
  <p> As you run you don't look back, still confused at how you ended up there in the first place you are grateful that you have finally escaped
