        You wait for the guard to walk past the locker and see him approach the room you first thought of hiding in.     
                            </p>
                            <p> As you see him walk past throught a tiny gap within the locker, he starts to apporach the locker you are in.</p>
                            <p> As he come in closer you hear a radio go off </p>
                            <p> The guards know that you aren't in your cell and gives them a heads up to search the area.</p>
                            <p>The guard then turns around and walks towards the other direction</p>
