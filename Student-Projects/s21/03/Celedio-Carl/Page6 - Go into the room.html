<p>When you enter a room, you see a lot of monitors and realize that this is a surveillance room. </p>

<p>Rushing to find an exit you scroll through the cameras and realize you are in an abandoned warehouse.</p>

<p>Seeing that there are no options to hide in the room you think twice and start to head for the exit to hide in the locker. As you head out the guard is outside the door and confronts you.
</p>
                                
<p>You are then escorted back into your cell and this time... they lock your cell
