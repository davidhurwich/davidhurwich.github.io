               Jules and Eddy talk to the cat because there is nothing else that they can do. It turns out the cat is a magic cat and gives Jules and Eddy advice to get out. The cat tells them to think mostly positively but negatively at
               the same time. The cat disappears and then they see a gremlin next to a door which is the way out. The gremlin asks, "What do dogs like and dislike at the same time?".
