               Jules and Eddy say "Vets" and that is the correct answer. Even though dogs do not like the vet because of the vaccines, they like them because they help them get better especially if they are dying. They make it to the door,
               but apparently, there is one more question before they can get through. The gremlin asks, "what is this?" and shows an "x".
