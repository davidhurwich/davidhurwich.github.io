    <p>You take the left trail. You continue galloping until you reach the edge of the waterfall. The guards catch up to you. You’re stuck and you have no choice, but to stay. “Maciana-” “Marci.” “Marci, we’re not going to hurt you if you comply. It’s going to grant you your freedom.” Your eyes light up, “What do you want?” “Reina, the princess, rebels took her.” Your eyes widen when you hear your ex-friend’s name. “I know you don’t want to want to see her, but the Monarch will fall without her and you have the skills to find her and bring her back, alive. Will you do it in exchange for your freedom?”
