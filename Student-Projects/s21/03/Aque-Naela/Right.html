    <p>You turn right. You continue galloping until you reach the edge of the mountain. You curse under your breath as you see the guards approach you. “Maciana-” “Marci.” “Marci, we’re not going to hurt you if you comply. It’s going to grant you your freedom.” Your eyes light up, “What do you want?” “Reina, the princess, rebels took her.” Your eyes widen when you hear your ex-friend’s name. “I know you don’t want to want to see her, but you have the skills to find her and bring her back, alive. Will you do it in exchange for your freedom?”
