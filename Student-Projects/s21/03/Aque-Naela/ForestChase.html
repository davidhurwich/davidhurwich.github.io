You grip onto Mono, your black horse, as he starts to gallop faster. You exit the village and enter the forest. “Marciana I order you to stop!” It was Lord Igillio’s voice who screamed. You turn around for a brief second and see one of the guards load a stake on a crossbow. This is not good you thought to yourself. Mono gallops faster as you begin to lose sight of the guards. There are two trails. Do you go left or right?
