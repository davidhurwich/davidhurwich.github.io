<p>In the very far future a post-apocalyptic continent is divided between humans, and monsters and mutants. The humans live in luxury while the monster and mutants are living in poverty. You know about this rebellion that’s been rising, but you don’t care. Right now you’re more worried of the human guards chasing you down. You’re wanted for accidentally killing a human during one of your bounty hunts. You hope you don’t reach a dead end because these guards have stakes. One puncture through your heart and you’re done. Lucky for you, you can stay under the sun during this fight. Benefits of being half human all.</p>
