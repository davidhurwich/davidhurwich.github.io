<p>She rejects Reina's friendship and returns her safely back to the Monarchy. The Monarchy continues to rule. Rebels are found and some go into hiding since you slayed their leader. Marci is granted immunity and lives in peace under the Monarchy, but the Monarchy's advisors don't let you see her. Are you really happy returning Reina?
