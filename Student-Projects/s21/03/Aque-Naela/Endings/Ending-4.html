<p>Before you can answer, you looked at Mono. You answer his offer by jumping off the waterfall with Mono knowing what will happen to you. You both stay on the edge of a cave near the waterfall, before you hear the guards leave. They assume you're gone. At night, you fled the outskirts of the Monarch and live in peace alone. You don't know what happened to the Monarch since Reina wasn't found.
