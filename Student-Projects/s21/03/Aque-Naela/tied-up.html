<p>After facing that obstacle you bust in the castle walls. You see vampire guards surround them and you stake them all. “Marci!” Reina screams at you. She’s tied up and Draven is right behind her holding a knife to her neck. You only see his figure as he’s wearing a cloak covering his whole body. You can’t really desifire what kind of monster he is. “Now, now you halfling. You don’t want your dear friend to die.” “She’s not really my friend just trying to get the Monarchy off my neck.” Reina is visibly hurt by your comment. “That’s fine with me.” Time slows down as he brings the knife to her neck. You reach for a weapon in your belt as fast you can.
