        <h2>
            "Get on!" one of the horsemen says to you. You grab their hand and <span style="color: #cc2d18">ride off into safety.</span> "Close call, guess you've already met the kraken cult or whatever they're called." They explain that they're travellers looking for a shortcut through this forest. They also offer you a way out, now that they've figured out their way out.
            <br><span style="color: #44ff3b">You've successfully escaped the forest!</span> Thank you for playing!
