            You traverse the spooky landscape. In your journey, you see <span style="color: #cc2d18">two human figures</span> walking through the forest. Dressed in black robes and looking ominous, they look around as they walk, as if searching for something, or someone. <span style="color: #cc2d18">They haven't spotted you yet.</span>
