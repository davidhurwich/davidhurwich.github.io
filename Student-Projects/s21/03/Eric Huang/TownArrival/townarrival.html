        <h2>
            You come across a quaint town, wooden homes standing in the quiet landscape. Some people come along to welcome you. <span style="color: #cc2d18">They tell you the way out of the forest is just through here</span>, but they insist on offering you some food and a drink for the road ahead. <span style="color: #cc2d18">Something seems off</span>, you don't know why that is.

            <a href="../MasksOff/masksoff.html">B) Politely decline, something's fishy</a>
