            Fists of fury! The two hooded figures didn't put up much of a fight and were swiftly knocked out. They didn't seem to be expecting you to attack them. As the dust settles, you hear a friendly voice from behind. Some <span style="color: #cc2d18">townsfolk</span> by the looks of it. <span style="color: #cc2d18">"Thank you for contributing! These no good drifters can be slippery. Unfortunately, you are one of them! May the Dark Lord guide us!</span> With a quick swoop, one of the <span style="color: #cc2d18">townspeople bashes you in the back of the head with a shovel. You black out.</span>
