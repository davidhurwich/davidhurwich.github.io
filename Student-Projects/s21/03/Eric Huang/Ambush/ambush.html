            You arrive at the town gates, it's a quaint little village. Suddenly, you feel a sharp pain in the back of your head. <span style="color: #cc2d18">You fall to the ground, ears ringing.</span> You catch a glimpse of one of the <span style="color: #cc2d18">townsfolk with a shovel, standing over you as you, seemingly the one who bashed you over the head.</span> You black out.
