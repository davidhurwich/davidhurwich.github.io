            The tentacles twitch and violently pulsate. At the same time, <span style="color: #cc2d18">all the tentacles explode</span>, leaving chunks of uncooked seafood all over the ground. Who would've guessed the weakness of eldritch horrors was 80's music.(Not that you'd know what that is in this medieval fantasy land) With nothing left to do, better get these restraints off.
