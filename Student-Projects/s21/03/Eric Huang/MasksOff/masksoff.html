            The townsfolk burst into a sudden fury. <span style="color: #cc2d18">"FINE, THIS WILL BE MUCH QUICKER! MAY THE DARK LORD GUIDE US!"</span> Someone swipes a knife at you. Thinking fast, you evade the blow and <span style="color: #cc2d18">begin running back into the forest. Panting and sweating, you see two robed figures on horseback.</span> The enraged townspeople are still close behind.
