            You spring forward! Feet planted firmly, you point at them and with a authoritative voice, question them about who they are and what's going on around here. Surprisingly, they oblige, telling you that <span style="color: #cc2d18">they are simple travelers, and that they are looking for their lost horses, who ran off during the night. They say if you help them, they will allow you to ride with them out of these woods.</span>
