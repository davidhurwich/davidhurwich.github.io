    <p>You have chosen the correct recycle bin to put the soda cans in, great job! Thank you for caring for the environment of the Mystical Monsterland, I bet the monsters will greatly appreciate your good deed. You are now able to pass through and continue on your journey.</p>
        
    <p>You've been walking for what feels like forever and you finally hear music playing faintly in the distance. You are interested to check it out, but you're also beginning to feel very tired from all the traveling you've done and you could use a short rest under a tree.</p>
        
    <p>Do you follow the music or rest here for a bit?</p>
