    <p>You've been dropped off at a secret location by the Council of Monsters which has assigned you the mission to find the Camp of Friendly Floofs before the Wicked Whatchamacallits find you. You better hurry though, because the Wicked Whatchamacallits already sense that you're here.</p> 
        
    <p>In front of you is a perfect straight trail with the greenest grass you've ever seen, the trees shaped like perfect round balls swaying happily back and forth in the wind. Flowers with smiling faces dance up and down beneath the shade of the trees. You've never seen anything so beautiful like this before. You look ahead and see something on the ground. You get closer and notice it's a backpack. Perhaps it was left for you by the Council of Monsters as a safety pack, but you still look around  to make sure no one left it here on accident. There is no one in sight so you open the backpack up and see red berries and some handy tools you may need along the way. You figure these items could be useful, so you end up taking the backpack. You continue along the trail with your backpack full of supplies, but suddenly you hear rustling in one of the bushes.</p> 
        
    <p>What could it be? You're scared, but also very excited to meet your first real monster. A small yellow monster slowly walks out of the bush. It's eyes widen and points to itself and says, "Kip." Kip notices your backpack full of supplies, especially the red berries. Kip points to your backpack and then rubs its stomach as if to tell you that its hungry. You take the backpack off of your shoulders and pull out each item in the backpack. Kip looked especially interested in the red berries and began rubbing its stomach frantically.</p>
        
    <p>Do you share your red berries with Kip or keep them for yourself and continue on the path?</p>
