    <p>You walk over to the edge of the river and scoop up some water with your hands. "This is the moment of truth," you think. You sip the water out of your hands and it tastes...interesting. Not as refreshing as you thought it would be, but enough to satisfy your thirst.</p>
        
    <p>Suddenly you begin to feel even more tired than you felt before. Your eyes begin to get heavier and heavier. In the distance you see a bright yellow monster with a striped arrow tail pouring a mysterious liquid into the river. "Sleep my friends, sleep!" you hear it saying. Oh no, it's Spike doing its tricks again. Before you know it you fall into a deep sleep. Your mission has been delayed and you are unable to make it to the Camp of Friendly Floofs in time. The next thing you know you are inside the ship of the Wicked Whatchamacallits. Next time, Earthling. </p>
