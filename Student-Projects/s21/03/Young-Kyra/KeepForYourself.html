    <p>You have decided to not share the red berries with Kip. You pack up and continue along the path and notice something ahead. There is a pile of empty soda cans scattered on the ground. There are two bins, one colored blue with arrows, and the other colored yellow. A sign says, "You shall pass only if you put the cans in the correct recycling bin."</p>
    
    <p>Which bin should you put the soda cans in?</p>
