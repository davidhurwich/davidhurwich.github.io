    <p>Despite being tired, you continued along the trail and followed the music ahead. As you got closer the music grew louder and louder. You look up to the sky and see flashing lights and colorful fireworks. But suddenly you are startled by a monster that jumps out from the bushes. "Welcome Earthling! We're so glad you made it. We hope your journey wasn't too difficult! Follow me, let's get you inside." You assume that the monster is a part of the Camp of Friendly Floofs so follow their lead inside. You join all types of monsters in their dances and  celebration and are greeted with delicous food and candy! Way to go Earthling, you completed the mission!</p>
