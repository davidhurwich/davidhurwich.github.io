    <p>You decline Tulip's help and continue along the path. You arrive at the sign that says, "This way to the Camp of Friendly Floofs!" and begin walking along the trail. The path then separates into five different directions, you're confused and lost. You should've accepted Tulips help! She is one of the most knowledgeable monsters you could've ever come across, despite how sassy she may have been. You end up spending too much time thinking about which path to go down and unfortunately you hear the Wicked Whatchamacallits tracking you down from behind. There is no where to hide. Guess you have to surrender. Next time, Earthling.</p>
