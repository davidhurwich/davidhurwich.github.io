    <p>You kneel down to gather a bunch of mushrooms. You set aside a pile for yourself to eat now and put some in your bag for later. You pick out the pink mushroom and take a bite. It tastes exactly like cotton candy, sweet and delicious! You eat more of the mushrooms and suddenly get a burst of energy. Those mushrooms must've been energy boosting mushrooms, great for you to continue on the journey! You pack everything up and search for a way to cross the river. You look around and notice a bridge that you can use to walk over to get to the other side.</p>
        
    <p>Once you arrive on the other side of the river you suddenly hear footsteps behind you. You turn around and see a little orange monster. The monster says in a sassy tone, "I'm Tulip. Where do you think you're going?" You introduce yourself and explain to Tulip that you're heading to the Camp of Friendly Floofs. Tulip grins and quickly replies, "I know exactly where that is! The path to the camp is a bit confusing and dangerous but I can show you the way, come on!" But while talking to Tulip you notice an old sign ahead that reads, "This way to the Camp of Friendly Floofs!"</p>
        
    <p>You think to yourself, "Why don't I just follow the sign? Should I trust Tulip?" What do you do?</p>
