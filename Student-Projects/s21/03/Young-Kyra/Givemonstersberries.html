    <p>Kip greatly appreciates your generosity and kindness! Sharing with others goes a long way in the Mystical Monsterland. Thanks to you Kip now has more energy to continue on the path just like you! Kip returns happily back into the bushes and you decide to continue on the path in search for the Camp of Friendly Floofs.</p>
        
    <p>It's been about a few minutes of walking and you see something ahead. You pick up your speed and find yourself at the edge of a river. The water is crystal clear with creatures swimming around and seaweed moving with the current. You begin to feel a little tired and hungry so you decide to recharge your energy and rest near the river for awhile. </p>
