    <p>Your stomach begins to growl and your mouth suddenly feels very dry. You take the backpack off of your shoulders and remember that you gave all your red berries to Kip back on the trail. You find a tree to sit under to take a break but right when you take a seat, you notice a patch of mushrooms of all shapes, sizes and colors. You don't know if they're edible or not, but you're starving for something to eat. On the other hand, you are also quite thirsty. There is a river right in front of you that you could drink water from, but you also don't know if it's clean.</p>
        
    <p>What do you do?</p>
