			You are lost and nothing to lose, so you accept his help. 
            <br>
            He guides you to the tent you left Joao, who is awake now. You and the guy help Joao, and you all go back to the city. 
            <br>
            You try to thank the guy, but he already ran off to talk with some woman.
