			"And then we have my favorite one. Iara, the Mother of Water. The legend says she was the gorgeous woman of her village and the most talented warriors of her tribe. Because of that, her brothers were extremely jealous of her and decided to kill her. But, she was able to defend herself and kill them first. As punishment Iara's father threw her in the river where fishes saved her life by transforming her into a beautiful siren. Today Iara lives in the rivers and tricks men to enter the rivers where she drowns them." - Joao said, trying to scare you.
