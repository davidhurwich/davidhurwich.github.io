			You and Joao hear something far away.

            "That's weird. I thought we were the only ones making this trail for the next few days." - Joao

            "what do you think it is?" - You
            <br><br>
            " I'm not sure! It's probably some tourists making the trail on their own. They have no idea how easy it is to get lost in this forest. That why it is against the law to do it without a tour guide! I will take a look. Do you want to come?"
