		<p class="intro">
			You decide to keep walking since it looks suspicious and end up at a river. You go close to the water trying to see a boat or something, but instead, you see pink Boto, a rare dolphin that leaves in the Amazonia rivers. 
            <br>
            You sit to think about what you should do since you are obviously lost. 
            <br>
            Out of nowhere, a man dress in white appears and offers some help.
