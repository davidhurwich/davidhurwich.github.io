			You tell Joao you are a little tired and stay at the camp. 
            
            After quite some time, you start to worry. You still hear the voice, but Joao is nowhere to be seen. 
            <br><br>
            You decide to stand up and look around, and to your surprise, you find footprints. 
            
            "I didn't see those before. Do they belong to the tourist Joao was talking about?" You think to yourself.
