                    Trucks of fully armed masked men have been circling around the city. You've been keeping your weapons on hand just in case someone sees you. You notice a gate in the distance but don't mind of it. Maybe you can go there later.<br><br>Moments later you see a tall man coming out the gas station near by. He looked just as confused as you. You quietly make your way to him.
