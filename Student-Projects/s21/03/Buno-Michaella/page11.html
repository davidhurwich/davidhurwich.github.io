                <p> The sun is setting and it's getting darker much quicker than you thought. You notice the unsual gated camp in the distance. Making your way over there, you're thinking about sneaking inside to find a place to stay for the night. Or maybe it's best not to risk it and walk away, and look for a different place to settle the night.</p>
