                    The photos on the camera are basic pictures of the city. But one picture caught your attention. You come across a photo of people infront of gates. It looked familiar to you but can't pinpoint where that area is.
                    <br>
                    You realize that the gates looked similar to the gates you saw earlier when you were walking around the city. Maybe there is something over there that could help.
