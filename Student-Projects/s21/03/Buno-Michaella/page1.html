                    You wake up in a cold and dark basement. You have a huge headache and have a sharp pain on your left leg. You lift up your pants and see a massive bruise. Suddenly you smell what seems like smoke...

                    <br><br>

                    <strong> *BAAAM!!*</strong> You hear an explosion from outside.

                    <br><br>

                    <em>Clark: What's going on? Where am I? Wasn't I in my cozy bed back home?</em>

                    <br><br>

                    You can either decide to get up quickly dealing with the pain to find a first aid kit or stay put, hoping this is all a dream.
