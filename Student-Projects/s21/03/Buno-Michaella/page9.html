                    With your gun loaded, you quietly make your way behind the counter ready to pull the trigger but you stop yourself because you see a guy completely terrified with his hands up.

                    <em> John: WAIT WAIT!! Dont shoot. Idk where I am. Please help me. </em>

                    <br><br>
