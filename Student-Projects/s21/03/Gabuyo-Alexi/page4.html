			In the pitbox you help Bricky and his crew prep the racecar, but it is taking a bit longer than usual as they need to compensate practically being one man down even if you are lending another helping hand.</p>

        <p class="p2">The driver is getting antsy and in his impatience accidentally trips and sprains his wrist. The injury makes him incapable operating the car. Bricky's pitcrew mechanics are all old and not exactly physically capable of racing even if they wanted to sub in.</p>

        <p class="p2">Bricky again looks at you and asks if you would like to drive the racecar.
