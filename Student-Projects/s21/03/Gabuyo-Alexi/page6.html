			You are carving up the competition lap after lap. Passing other racers nearly at will. Out braking them into corners and out accelerating them while exiting the corners. Overtake after overtake you have finally made it towards the front, but there is only one lap left to pass the final car in the field for the lead. </p>
        
        <p class="p2">That driver is putting up a resilient fight throughout the lap, you will only have one opportunity to pass and it'll be into the last corner of the race.
