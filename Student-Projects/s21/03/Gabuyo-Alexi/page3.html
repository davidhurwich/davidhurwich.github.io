			You have arrived at the race track and help Bricky unload the racecar in the track's paddock. He receives a phone call and realizes that someone on his pitcrew has had an emergency and won't be able to make it down for the race. Bricky looks to you and asks if you'd be interested in subbing in for that pit member.
