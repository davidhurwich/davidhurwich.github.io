                After you zip-up your onesie you are ready to sneak out of your room. Once you're out you
                you successfully make it downstairs without a sound and you're one step closer to the kitchen. Then you come around the corner and peek to your left side and see Mom but before you approach you look over to the play room on your right and can choose a toy to use as a distraction.
