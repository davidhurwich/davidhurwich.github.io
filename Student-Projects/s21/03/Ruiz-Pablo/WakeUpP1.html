                You find yourself waking up in bed after your midday nap. Suddenly you smell the scent of fresh cookies that have just been pulled out the oven. You're hungry and want to eat a cookie before lunch but you know your mom won't let you. Now your mission begins to sneak into the kitchen and grab a cookie and sneak back into your room without getting caught. But before you go down the stairs you have to suit up.
