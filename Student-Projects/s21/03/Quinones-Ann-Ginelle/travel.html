    <h1>Traveling with Kenneth</h1>
    
    <section id="text">
        <p>
            You have spent the past month traveling with Kenneth to parts of the world you never even knew existed. He has shown you the perks of being a vampire. You have done everything on anyone's bucket list that you never thought you could achieve in a lifetime. Maybe becoming a vampire was the best thing that could've happened to you.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As you're reminiscing in your thoughts while looking at the most beautiful sunset, Kenneth walks up from behind you and sits beside you. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            "Penny for your thoughts?" he says softly as he tries to read your face.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You sigh and say, "This past month has been...amazing to say the least."
        </p>
        
        <p>
            "...But?"
        </p>
        
        <p>
           "But, it's all so unreal. This isn't real. I should be dead, yet I'm traveling the world and seeing the best sights and living my best life, but I... miss my bestfriend. I feel...alone."
        </p>
        
        <p>
            He grabs the nape of your neck and brings your face so close to his, your foreheads are touching when he says, "You are NOT alone. I'm here. I'm right here. And I will always be here. I mean, I am immortal after all, darling."
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You sit back and have a moment with your thoughts again. <em>Would he stay beside her for eternity? Eternity is a looong time. Or should I run?</em> As attracted as you are to him and even though he's been the perfect gentleman to you, you feel like you just need space to think and time to yourself. But, where would you go? Can you control your cravings when you're by yourself? He's been there to distract you when you're on the verge of breaking. But, this is your life now, because of him.
