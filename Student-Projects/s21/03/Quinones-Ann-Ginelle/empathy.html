            "That's enough. I said that's enough!" Kenneth yells as he grasps your hair from the roots and pulls you apart from your third target practice. You're about to yell you need more when he pulls your face an inch away from his own, your noses are grazing each other as you focus on his eyes. His bright blue eyes with a sparkle of light brown. His gaze has such a calming, yet intense look, it takes your breathe away.

            He smirks and gently releases his hold on your hair, caressing his fingers down the back of your neck, then down the lining of your jaw, then slowly closes your jaw that you didn't even realize was hanging open. Then, he rubs the dripping blood off from your bottom lip with his thumb.

            He heals the stranger that was my dinner with his blood and glamours him into forgetting what just happened so she could go about her day. He says, "I think you're ready."

            "Ready for what?"

            "Have you traveled the world?"
