    <h1>Wedding Day</h1>
    
    <section id="text">
        <p>It’s finally here. Today’s YOUR day. Your wedding day.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Your bridesmaid says it’s almost time to head down the aisle. You ask for a minute alone and you’ll be out. As she leaves, you take one last sip of your glass of wine to calm your nerves. Then, you take one last look into the full-length mirror. Everything's perfect and you're ready to marry your best friend, James. But, just as you turn around to leave, something blurry moves swiftly from the shadows and everything goes dark.

            You open your eyes and wake up laying on the floor. Confused, you slowly get up and realize your neck is sore. <em>What happened?</em> As you stand, you suddenly feel a strong sense of hunger, as if you haven't eaten in years and it's all you can think about. You feel so hungery, the pain is starting to turn to rage. As you glance past the mirror, you noticed something off. You look into the mirror and see your eyes go red and veins quickly run down from the bottom of your eye sockets. <em>What is happening?!</em> Should you go look for your fiance, James, or go look for help from someone else?
