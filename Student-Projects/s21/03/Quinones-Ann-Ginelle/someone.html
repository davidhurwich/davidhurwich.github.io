        <p>As you head down the hallway, your hunger and rage is growing and growing by the second. It's as if you're in a blind rage, all you see is red. You start to panic and run faster. Next thing you know, you bump into someone so hard, you crash onto the floor.
        </p>
        
        <p>You look up and see a tall man with wavy brunette hair brushed off to the side. You noticed he's also pretty lean to have you flying to the ground from running into him. <em>What happened?</em> He's also in a suit, as if he's dressed up for the wedding, but you don't recognize him. <em>Who is he?</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>"There you are. And where do you think you're running off to?" he says.
        </p>
        
        <p>As you scramble up on your feet, you beg him for help. "Please sir, can you help me? I don't know what's going on."
        </p>
        
        <p>"You're in the process of becoming a vampire, and I can help you. Let's go for a walk," he says as he hold out his hand like a gentleman.</p>
        
        <p><em>A what?!? A <strong>VAMPIRE!?</strong> He must be crazy, right?</em>
        </p>
        
        <p>What do you do?</p>
