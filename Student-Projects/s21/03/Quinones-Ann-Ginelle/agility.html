            Running around from point A to point B at the speed of a blink of an eye is exhilerating! You've caught 4 squirrels already, but it's so fun, you're doing it for sport now that you're not focused on the hunger. You almost feel normal again. At least, as normal as you could be for a newborn vampire.

            "You know, you have a beautiful smile. You should smile more often", he smirks.

            You scoff. "I <em>was</em> happy, until you made me into...this." 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            "You weren't happy. You were content and about to marry your bestfriend, not your true love. You deserve happiness and passion, you're too beautiful to suffice for anything less."
        </p>

            Before you're capable of ranting on about how wrong he is, you turn and stop as your eyes are 1 inch away from his lips. As you look up to meet his gaze, everything he said sinks in to your soul, as if his words tore down the brick wall you put up inside you to hide your true feelings. You don't want to admit it but he's right. He was your high school sweetheart and you couldn't bear to break his heart because if you did, you'd lose your bestfriend too.

            Kenneth brushes a bang in your face out of the way and says, "I think you're ready now."

        <p>
            "Ready for what?"
        </p>
        
        <p>
            "To travel the world, and I can show you everything you deserve."
