    <h1>Found James</h1>
    
    <section id="text">
        <p>You quickly shut the door behind you and find no one's in the room. 
        </p>
        
        <p>"James?" you loudly whisper.
        </p>
        
        <p>Just then, James walks out of the bathroom door. He pauses, shocked to see you.
        </p>
        
        <p>"Katrina! What are you doing here? I'm not supposed to see you...wait... what's wrong with your eyes?" he asks.
        </p>
        
        <p>You're relieved to see him, but then you smell something sweet in the air. As you're sniffing around to find the direction it's coming from, you realize it's getting stronger with every step you take towards James. He slowly backs up with his hands in front of him, trying to create space between you two as he's starting to be afraid. You realize you can sense his fear raising, but the smell is so overwhelming, you can't help to get closer. Then, you notice his racing heart pulsing through a fat vein on the side of his neck. As you watch it throbbing, your mouth starts salivating out of control.</p>
        
        <p>"I'm SO <strong>HUNGRY!</strong>" you growl.</p>
        <p>He offers to grab you food, but that's not what you want. What you CRAVE.</p>
        <p>You feel the top of your gums start to get sore, as you say your last words...</p>
