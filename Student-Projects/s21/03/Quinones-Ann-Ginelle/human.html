            You wake up confused. You're in a hospital bed, tubes connected to you, and a bouquet of flowers on the table next to your bed. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            "You're awake?"
        </p>
        
        <p>
            You turn to see James on the other side of the bed. It looks like he fell asleep on a chair that he scooted next to the bed.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            "Oh, thank goodness you're okay! I was worried sick!"
        </p>
        
        <p>
            "What happened?"
        </p>
        
        <p>
            "I was gonna ask you that. I thought you left me at the alter, but then we got a call from the hospital saying they found you passed out outside the hospital doors."
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <em>What's happening? I feel fine now. No more cravings. No intense feelings. No rage. Just... nothing but normalcy. Did he really cure me? Or was it all just a dream?</em>
