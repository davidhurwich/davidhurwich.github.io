Leota has sent you to the attic. Its dark and cold, and what are all of these pictures? You hear a noise and turn around to find the bride Leota’s fortune spoke about. She’s a ghost you don’t want to anger. The bride is known for killing her husbands, 8 in all as you’ve seen from their wedding photos.  
         The bride has been waiting for a mortal to visit her attic. Will you run away from her or venture through the attic to see what waits ahead?
