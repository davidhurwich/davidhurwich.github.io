 You’re a brave one, welcome to the Haunted Mansion. You’ll have to face several grim grinning ghosts and happy haunts along the way to find your way out of here. If you think you can handle it, ascend the staircase.
       
        At the top of the staircase there are two hallways with a door at the end of each. Which one will you pick? Or more importantly, what will be waiting for you on the other side?
