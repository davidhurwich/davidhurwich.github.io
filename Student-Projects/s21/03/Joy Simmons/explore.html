        Oliver finally convinces Julia that exploring the abandoned house would be exciting and fun, something they were not used to. They ride their bikes down the dirt road to the old house. No one had lived there in over 70 years, and most people steer clear of the old house.

    Despite the scary presence of the house, Oliver walks right through the front door as Julia hesitantly followed. After exploring a few rooms, Oliver stumbles across a large object covered in a cloth. He carefully pulls the cloth off, and reveals a weird looking machine. They had never seen anything like it.
