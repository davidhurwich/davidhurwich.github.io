 Oliver and Julia begin walking around the futuristic town, in hopes to see something or someone that could help them. The two friends looked extremely out of place wearing clothes from 2025 and got many weird stares from people on the street. As they were searching, Oliver sees a poster that read, “Lucas Milton: Live Tonight!” 
 </p>
 
<p>
Oliver taps on the shoulder of a woman and asks who Lucas Milton is. Shocked that he had no clue, she tells him he’s the descendant of a time traveler who tells his great great grandfather’s stories.
