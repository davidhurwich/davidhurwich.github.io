        Oliver and Julia arrive at the restaurant and see Lucas Milton at the bar. Oliver runs to Lucas, screaming about how his grandfather ruined everything, and demanding he fix the time machine to send the two friends back home. Lucas was offended that Oliver would blame him for a mistake he made, and refuses to help. Although Lucas has recreated a time machine from Abrahamâ€™s blueprints, he tells Oliver he will not be helping them. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Oliver and Julia are stuck in the year 2125, unless they manage to fix the machine on their own, but with lack of time travel knowledge, they will likely never make it back to their home!
