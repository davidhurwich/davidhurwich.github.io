 Turns out, the future does have a library, and it was in the same exact spot as Oliver and Juliaâ€™s time. Julia quickly rushes to a computer. After figuring out how it works, she finds a few articles about Abraham Milton. She learns that 50 years after she was born, Abraham was an inventor, but died before he could present his time machines to the world.

After some more digging, Julia discovers that Abraham had a great great grandson, Lucas Milton, that lived nearby. If Oliver and Julia found him, maybe he could help them get back home.
