        Lucas Milton was at the restaurant they assumed he’d be at! Julia politely walks up to Lucas and introduces herself and Oliver. She explains what happened, and how they found him after researching Abraham Milton. Ecstatic, Lucas shows them the time machine he recreated using Abraham’s blueprints.

        Oliver and Julia were successfully transported back to the year 2025. They spent the rest of the Summer talking all about their crazy adventure and the year 2125.
