 Oliver and Juliaâ€™s hard work paid off! Using the information they gathered, they learned that Lucas Milton would most likely be at a restaurant only a few blocks away. As they head toward the location they wonder what the best way to convince Lucas to help them would be. Julia thinks it would be best to get to know Lucas and ask nicely, but Oliver insists Lucas owes them the favor and that they should demand he fixes the problem his great great grandfather caused.
