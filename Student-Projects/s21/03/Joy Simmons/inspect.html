 Oliver decides to see what some of the buttons on the machine do. Before he can push anything, Julia trips over the cloth and is sent flying into the machine. The machine makes whirring noises and few clunks, sending Julia into what looked like outer space. With haste, Oliver jumps into the machine to find his friend.

<p>

After a few seconds, the two friends land head first on a busy street. Everything looked much different than home. They looked back at the machine and read the words, “Time Machine by Abraham Milton”. They had be transported into the year 2125, by the machine!

Julia suggests their best bet to getting back home is to find out more about the inventor, Abraham Milton. She says the local library probably has information, but Oliver thinks there are no libraries in the future and that they should just ask around.
