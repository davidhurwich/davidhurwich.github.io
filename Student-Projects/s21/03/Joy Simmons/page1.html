        In the sleepy little town of Rockville where nothing ever happens, lived two friends, Oliver and Julia. The two friends were excited that Summer had finally arrived and they were looking for something fun to do. Oliver suggested exploring the abandoned house down the street, but Julia thought it was a dangerous idea and suggested staying home and watching some TV.
