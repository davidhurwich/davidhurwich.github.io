                <p>Originally, we decided to brew in the British style, so it made a lot of sense to commission our brewery from a UK manufacturer. After a strong recommendation from the folks at <em>Kelham Island Brewery</em> in Sheffield, we contacted <strong>Mr. Vincent Johnson</strong> of Johnson Brewing Design. This guy knows a lot about beer and brewing, and once you can understand him (through that thick Northern accent), he is a mine of information.</p>
                <p>The 6 UK barrel brewery was manufactured in Bury, Lancashire (home of black pudding) in 2012 and Big V himself ventured over late in the year to weld in all the pipework and commission the brewery. Hence, the first brew was called “Big V Amber” which is now a staple at Freewheel.</p>

               <p>Orion started with us in October. He is a man of many talents and spent years as a stone carver in addition to brewing for over a decade. Originally from Vermont he relocated to the Bay 15 years ago.
                Outside of work Orion is an experienced telemark skier, Burning Man legend and world traveler.</p>

                  <p>Oakland native Alex joins Freewheel by way of Anchor Brewing, the San Francisco Meadery, and a past life in tech. When he’s not cleaning (and occasionally making beer!) at the brewery, he enjoys exploring the great outdoors with his wife and dog, discovering new craft beer, and cleaning brew equipment (and occasionally making beer!) at home.</p>
