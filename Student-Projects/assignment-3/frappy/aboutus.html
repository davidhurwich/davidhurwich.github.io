                <p class="aboutus">“FrappyCrinkles” was established in 2017 by a Filipino couple who transferred to Sac State from the Bay Area. Neither of them had much baking experience, but took a leap in starting a side business to help alleviate financial stress as college students. Francesca began coming up with original “Frappy” recipes and prepping dough, while Vanden manages public relations and majority of the baking. In addition to using their income from their side hustle for housing rent and school tuition, they also find ways to give back to their community by hosting fundraisers. Francesca and Vanden are extremely grateful for all the support they have received thus far, especially from their friends, family, and members of Kappa Psi Epsilon- a Filipino-based organization that they joined together back in college. They went on a hiatus in 2019 and officially graduated as undergrads in 2020, then plans to make a huge “FRAPPY” comeback in 2021. Stay posted on upcoming fundraisers, new surprise flavor drops, and an updated website by following their instagram account: @frappycrinkles!</p>
