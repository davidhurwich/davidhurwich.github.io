                    For gluten-free or vegan families, visiting traditional bakeries isn’t much fun, since people can usually only pick from one or two of the offerings. "I think when you have dietry restrictions or alergies, you seek stuff out," one of our staff members say, noting that she used to drive 45 minutes to a bakery to give her daughter the chance to pick from a full shelf of gluten-free pastry options. At our bakery people are given that opprotunity.

                    <h7>Just like veganism is the sustainable option when it comes to looking after our planet, plant-based living is also a more sustainable way of feeding the human family. A plant-based diet requires only one third of the land needed to support a meat and dairy diet. With rising global food and water insecurity due to a myriad of environmental and socio-economic problems, there's never been a better time to adopt a more sustainable way of living. Avoiding animal products is not just one of the simplest ways an individual can reduce the strain on food as well as other resources, it's the simplest way to take a stand against inefficient food systems which disproportionately affect the poorest people all over the world.</h7>
