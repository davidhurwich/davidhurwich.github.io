                Finally, you have reached the large tree, which up close is so bright that it nearly blinds your eyes.
                You take notice of the trunk and have it spiral into a face with eyes glowing light blue. As you get
                closer to the tree, you hear it again. <br><br><em>Unlucky or lucky? Which one are you?</em> <br><br>
                The tree
                was speaking to you in some way.<br><br><em>"Choose a course which will lead to your future. Choose
                    which
                    door you wish to enter."</em><br><br> Looking around, you see two doors with a lantren on your left
                side and
                right side. They look the same, only the left side is filled with more trees surrounding it. <br>
                <br><b>Which
                    one will you choose? <br><br>The left door or the right door?</b>
            </p>
