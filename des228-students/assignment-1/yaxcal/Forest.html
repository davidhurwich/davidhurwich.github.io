                You decide to continue moving forward, passing the cherry blossoms and watching out for any lanterns that you might step on while walking. You're top, not again...<br><br>You are left with three different paths once again. <br><br> <em>The left goes towards a larger rock that you can seem to walk through, leading to a path. <br><br> The road seems to be going up towards the mountains. <br><br> Straight ahead, you can see a bridge where you would have to cross.  </em><br><br> <b>What's on the other side? Which will you decide?</b>
