                Continuing down the dirt path, you look towards where the path leads, towards an open building with a
                large tree in the middle, sticking out in your view.<br> So tall. <br> Why is it in the middle of the
                palace-like structure? <br> How can it grow from within? <br><b>Odd. </b><br> Cursitoity gets the better
                of you, and the tree seems to be calling to you. <br> <em>Lucky or unlucky? </em><br> <b>What does that
                    mean? </b><br> You continue towards the tree to learn more about it.
