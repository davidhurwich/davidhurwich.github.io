                Going towards the figure, instead of being a humna, it seems to be a statue of a fox. <br> You swear you saw someone here. <br> Hmm. <br> The figure seems to glow bright as you get near it.  <br><br><em> What does this mean? <br><br> Perhaps by touching the statue, what active something?</em>
