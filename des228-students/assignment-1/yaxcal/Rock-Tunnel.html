                Going towards the rock tunnel, you see that nearby is a village with houses. <br><br><em>(Who would want to live by this huge mountain rock pathway?) </em><br><br> You go up the stairs through the rock-mountain. <br> You see, you have two options. <em><br><br> On your left, there seems to be a firgue in the distance. Maybe ask someone for help? <br><br>On your right, there is a large tree that is a bright purple.</em> <br><br><b>Which way will you choose?</b>
