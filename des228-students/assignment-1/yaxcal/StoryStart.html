                You decide to start your journey. You get up off the dirt path that you were lying on, dusting yourself off and looking around you. Looking around, you see a dirt path towards your left, going far into the trees. Looking ahead of you, there is a path that leads higher up. Maybe you can get a better view up there? On your right, you can hear in the distance the sound of water falling down a stream, perhaps a waterfall. Which one will you decide?<br><br>Where do you go from here? <br><br><em>Forward up the higher path? </em> <br><em>Towards the dirt path on the left?</em> <br><em>Or to your right, to the waterfall?</em> <br><br><b>Only you get to decide.</b> <br>
