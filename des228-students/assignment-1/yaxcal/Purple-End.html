                Choosing purple, you are blinded by a purple light and you open your eyes in shock with the sound of a
                thunderstruck. <br><br> Your eyes widen at what you see before you and where you are now. <br><br> In
                the middle
                of the forbidden island of Liyue, which is filled with lightning and thunder.<br> <br> Within the fill,
                you
                were not able to dodge the thunder, getting stuck, so you ended up getting fired.<br> <br>
