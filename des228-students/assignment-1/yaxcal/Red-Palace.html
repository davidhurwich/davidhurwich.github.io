                You are nearly out of breath with the hill and rocky path you had to go up just to get there. Looking up, you see you are led to a red palace, surrounded by a pool filled with water where pink cherry blossoms have fallen.<br> <br><em>Maybe your answers will all be answered here.</em> <br>
                <br>Going up the stairs towards the door, you start to take notice of the details of the building with the golden yellow flowers on the doors. <br>
                <br>You put you hands on the door handle to enter the building.
