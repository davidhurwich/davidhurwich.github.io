                Walking through, you are left with a bright light blinding you, only to open your eyes to the dark sky and three gates standing in front of you. You start to examine each gate. Through it, you don't feel anything would happen when walking through it, yet you know better than that. <br>
                <em><br>The gate on the left is surrounded by bright yellow flowers.<br> <br> The larger gate is straight ahead, with a statue on the floor guarding it a bit, it seems. The hem of the gate in front of you is purple.<br><br> A light blue lit up dandelions is floating around the gate on the right.</em> <br>
                <br><b>Which one will you choice to walk through?</b>
